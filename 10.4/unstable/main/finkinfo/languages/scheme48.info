DescDetail: <<
Scheme48 is an implementation of Scheme written by Richard Kelsey and 
Jonathan Rees. It is based on a byte-code interpreter and is designed 
to be used as a testbed for experiments in implementation techniques 
and as an expository tool.

Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of
the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and 
Gerald Jay Sussman of MIT. It was designed to have an exceptionally 
clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.
A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, 
functional, and message passing styles, find convenient expression
in Scheme.
