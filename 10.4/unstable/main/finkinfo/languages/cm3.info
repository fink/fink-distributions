Description: Critical Mass Modula-3 Compiler Bundle
DescDetail: <<
This package pulls in all Critical Mass Modula-3 related packages, both the
compiler and its documentation. This is probably your ideal choice for actual
Modula-3 development.

If you just want to compile some Modula-3 package, cm3-dev should be
sufficient. To run dynamically linked cm3 programs, install cm3-shlibs.
