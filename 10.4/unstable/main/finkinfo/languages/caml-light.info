DescDetail: <<
Caml is a programming language, easy to learn, easy to use, and yet amazingly
powerful. It is developed and distributed by INRIA (the main French research
institute for computer science), since 1984. There exist two flavors of Caml:
Caml Light and Objective Caml. Caml Light is merely a subset of Objective
Caml, especially designed for teaching and learning the art of programming.
<<

DescUsage: <<
Run 'camllight' to start the top-level. Install the Tuareg emacs mode for 
convenient editing (package forthcoming). Install caml-light-plugins to add 
X11 graphics support.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
The caml-light sources are split in two : the compiler (caml-light package) 
and all the ``plugins'' found in the contrib/ directory (caml-light-plugins). 
The license distributed with the package forbids patches, but it is currently
being changed to an open-source license. Meanwhile, Pierre Weis (one of
the authors) told me that I was allowed to distribute my patch.
<<

DescPort: <<
Since cpp 3.0 is not installed anymore with XCode 1.5 (unless you choose 
explicitly to install it), I had to change the Makefiles in order
to delete the annoying #pragma gcc set_debug_pwd...
I also added a RUNDIR option to the Makefile to make the install process
compatible with Fink. (so the scripts are much simpler now than
the ones in revision 1 where we had to do install in all the subdirectories
ourselves). (when I wrote revision 1 this patch had not yet been authorized by 
Weis...)
