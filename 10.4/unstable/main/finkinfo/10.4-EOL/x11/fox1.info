DescDetail: <<
Toolkit which looks like Windwows but is quite different internally.
It is used by FreeRIDE, the ruby IDE.
Written in C++
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Tries to link the C++ library with $CC which does not fail but produces
 useless result. Somebody at the mailing list said that supplying a recent
 libtool and regenerating the files created with auto* should fix the problem.
 But the library created in this way was a bit unstable.
 -no-undefined should make libtool not force flat namespace. Twolevel libraries
 are supposed to be prebindable.

 This version is compiled with g++3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, fox1 and fxscintilla (as well as
 any packages which depend on either of them) must be updated at the same time.
