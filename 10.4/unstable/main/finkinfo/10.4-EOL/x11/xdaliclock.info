Description: Dali Clock is a digital clock
DescDetail: <<
Dali Clock is a digital clock. When a digit changes, it "melts" into its
new shape. It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and the date is displayed
when the mouse is pressed. It has four large fonts built into it, but it
can animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits.The window
can be made transparent, and can do funky psychedelic color cycling.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package installs an X11 version of xdaliclock into %p/sw/bin.
It also installs a clickable OS X .app into /Applications/Fink
<<
DescPort: <<
There is a screensaver xcodebuild target available as well, but it seems
to require the 10.6 SDK.
