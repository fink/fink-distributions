# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Convert man pages to DocBook format
DescDetail: <<
The doclifter program translates documents written in troff macros to DocBook.
Lifting documents from presentation level to semantic level is hard, and
a really good job requires human polishing.  This tool aims to do everything
that can be mechanized, and to preserve in XML comments any troff-level 
information that might have structural implications.  Also includes manlifter,
a driver script that can be used to convert entire manual-page hierarchies.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Remove import of the sre module, which has been deprecated in recent
Python versions. Also replaced 'with' in one spot, as this will be a
reserved keyword in future Python versions.
