Description: Read/Write Mac HFS media
DescDetail: <<
With this program you can read and write Macintosh-formatted media
such as floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and SCSI hard disks on most UNIX platforms.
You can also format raw media into an HFS volume.
    This package contains a number of different tools:
    * Several command-line programs (hmount, hls, hcopy, et al.)
    * A Tk-based front-end for browsing and copying files through a
      variety of transfer modes (MacBinary, BinHex, text, etc.)
    * A Tcl package and interface for scriptable access to volumes
    * A C library for low-level access to volumes
<<
DescUsage: <<
For the tk-based front-end just type 'xhfs' at the command prompt inside an
X environment.
