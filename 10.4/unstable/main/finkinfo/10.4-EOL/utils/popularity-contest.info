# Config file for Debian's popularity-contest package.
#
# To change this file, remove it and use:
#        dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest
#
# You can also edit it by hand, if you so choose.

# PARTICIPATE can be one of "yes" or "no".
# If you don't want to participate in the contest, say "no"
# and we won't send messages.
#
# If this option is missing, the default is "no".

# MAILTO specifies the address to e-mail statistics to each week.

# MY_HOSTID is a secret number that the popularity-contest receiver
# uses to keep track of your submissions.  Whenever you send in a
# new entry, it overwrites the last one that had the same HOSTID.
#
# This key was generated automatically so you should normally just
# leave it alone.
#
MY_HOSTID="$MY_HOSTID"

# MAILFROM is the forged sender email address you want to use in
# email submitted to the popularity-contest.  If this is commented
# out, no From: or Sender: lines will be added to the outgoing mail,
# and it will be your MTA's job to add them.  This is usually what
# you want.
#
# If your MTA is misconfigured or impossible to configure correctly,
# and it always generates invalid From: and/or Sender: lines, you
# can force different results by setting MAILFROM here.  This can
# cause problems with spam bouncers, so most people should leave it
# commented out.
