Description: Interpreter for the AWK Programming Language
DescDetail: <<
	mawk (Mike's AWK) is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language.
	The AWK language is useful for manipulation of data files, text
	retrieval and processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with
	algorithms. mawk is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as
	defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language,
	Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK
	book.) mawk conforms to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the
	AWK language which contains a few features not described in the AWK
	book, and mawk provides a small number of extensions.
