Description: Tool to replay captured net traffic
DescDetail: <<
tcpreplay is a BSD-style licensed tool to replay saved tcpdump files
at arbitrary speeds.  It provides a variety of features for replaying
traffic for both passive sniffer devices as well as inline devices
such as routers, firewalls, and the new class of inline IDS's.

This program was written in the hopes that a more precise testing
methodology might be applied to the area of network intrusion
detection, which is still a black art at best.

Many NIDSs fare poorly when looking for attacks on heavily-loaded
networks.  tcpreplay allows you to recreate real network traffic from
a real network for use in testing.

tcpreplay includes the following tools:

* tcpreplay - the tool for replaying capture files
* tcpprep - a capture file pre-processor for creating cache files for tcpreplay
* capinfo - the tool for printing statistics about capture files
* pcapmerge - a tool for merging pcap files into one larger one (1.4.x only)
* flowreplay - a tool for replaying connections (1.5.x only)
