DescDetail: <<
md5deep is a cross-platform set of programs to compute MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256
Tiger, or Whirlpool message digests on an arbitrary number of files.  The
programs run on Windows, Linux, *BSD, OS X, Solaris, and should run on most
other platforms.  md5deep is similar to the md5sum program found in the GNU
Coreutils package, but has the following additional features:

* Recursive operation - md5deep is able to recursive examine an entire
  directory tree.  That is, compute the MD5 for every file in a directory and
  for every file in every subdirectory.
* Time estimation - md5deep can produce a time estimate when it's processing
  very large files.
* Comparison mode - md5deep can accept a list of known hashes and compare them
  to a set of input files.  The program can display either those input files
  that match the list of known hashes or those that do not match.  Hashes sets
  can be drawn from the National Software Reference Library, iLook
  Investigator, Hashkeeper, or md5sum, and other generic hash generating
  programs.  Users are welcome to add functionality to read other formats too!
* File type mode - md5deep can process only files of a certain type, such as
  regular files, block devices, etc.
