Revision: 1
Description: Pipe utility "y": treats backticks as filenames
DescDetail: <<
The y utility is used to create systems of pipes and fifos (named
pipes) more complicated than standard shell syntax allows. A single
invocation of y has the following effect: a temporary fifo is created;
the name of this fifo is printed on standard output; and y exits,
leaving a child process in the background to copy any data received on
standard input to the fifo. The net effect of this is that you can use
the expression `subcommand | y` anywhere on a command line that you
would use a filename, and the output of subcommand will be piped
appropriately to create the illusion that `subcommand | y` is a file,
containing the output of subcommand.

This version has the ability to specify a mask for the filename.
