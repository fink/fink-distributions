Description: Set of utilities to manage your TV viewing 
DescDetail: <<
  XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work with TV
  listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The idea is
  to separate out the backend (getting the listings) from the frontend
  (displaying them for the user), and to implement useful operations like
  picking out your favourite programmes as filters that read and write XML
  documents. 

  There are two backends at present, grabbing TV listings for three different
  countries. There are filters to sort the listings by date, to remove shows
  that have already been broadcast, and a CGI script to semi-automatically
  pick things to watch. There are a couple of backends to produce printed
  output. 

  This software is still being developed and requires familiarity with a
  command line; but it does work.

DescPackaging: <<
As of 0.5.57 AKH:
	reverted the nomenclature back to "xmltv".
	Set the package to use perl588 since that's available on all distros.
	Separated revisions for every distro since the path to the perl interpreter
	changes with 10.4 -> 10.5 and 10.5 -> 10.6, so upgraders will need to rebuild the package.
	Cleaned up the unnecessary BuildDepends which were listed in the Depends: line.
