Description: Java Mail (SMTP/IMAP/POP) API
DescDetail: <<
The JavaMail 1.4 API provides a set of abstract classes that model a
mail system.  The API provides a platform independent and protocol
independent framework to build Java technology-based mail and
messaging applications.  The JavaMail API is implemented as a Java
platform optional package and is also available as part of the Java
2 platform, Enterprise Edition.  Sun provides a royalty-free
reference implementation, in binary form, that developers will be
able to use and ship.  The POP3 service provider is now bundled with
JavaMail 1.3 API.
