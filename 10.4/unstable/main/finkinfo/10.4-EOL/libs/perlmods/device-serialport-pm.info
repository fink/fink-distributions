# Compile Phase.
# The module can test the communication with the serial port, if it is
# specified during the build process.  These tests are disabled by default.
# If you want to run the tests, copy this .info file to your local tree, 
# uncomment the following line, edit it to specify the serial port and 
# comment out the NoPerlTests line.
#ConfigureParams: TESTPORT=/dev/tty.USA49W1b1P1.1
NoPerlTests: true

# Install Phase.
DocFiles: README TODO MANIFEST Changes
UpdatePOD: true

# Additional Info:
DescDetail: << 
  This module is a POSIX emulation of the Win32::SerialPort module.
<<
DescPackaging:<<
  The tests, if run, require that nothing be plugged into the serial port.
  If a USB to Serial adapter is used to provide the serial port, it must be
  plugged into the computer.
  
  The tests are very sensitive to timing issues, and they are more likely to
  pass if they are not competing with other applications for CPU time.  Stop
  other applications if the tests fail and try to install again.
