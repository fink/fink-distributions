Description: Safe cleanup blocks
DescDetail: <<
	This module implements so-called "guards". A guard is something (usually
	an object) that "guards" a resource, ensuring that it is cleaned up when
	expected.
	
	Specifically, this module supports two different types of guards: guard
	objects, which execute a given code block when destroyed, and scoped
	guards, which are tied to the scope exit.
