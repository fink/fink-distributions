Description: Simple portaudio bindings for python
DescPort: <<
PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform audio I/O
Library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a
variety of platforms.

PyAudio is designed to work with the PortAudio v19 API 2.0. Note that PyAudio
currently only supports blocking-mode audio I/O. PyAudio is still super-duper
alpha quality.
