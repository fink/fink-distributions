Description: Enhanced vi-like text editor
DescDetail: <<
vile ("Vi Like Emacs") is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi. 
It has extended capabilities in many areas, including multi-file editing and 
viewing, mouse support, infinite undo, additional operators, and rectangular 
operations. Vile has an optional Perl interface for UNIX and NT. It can also 
be built as "xvile", which is fully X-aware, or "winvile" for Win32, with 
scrollbars, menus, etc.
