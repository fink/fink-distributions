DescDetail: <<
This is a major mode for editing Python programs.  It was developed by Tim
Peters after an original idea by Michael A. Guravage.  Tim subsequently
left the net and in 1995, Barry Warsaw inherited the mode.  Tim's now back
but disavows all responsibility for the mode.  In fact, we suspect he
doesn't even use Emacs any more.  In 2003, python-mode.el was moved to its
own SourceForge project apart from the Python project, and now is
maintained by the volunteers at the python-mode@python.org mailing list.

DescUsage: <<
When in a Python mode buffer, do a C-h m for help.

DescPackaging: <<
The python-mode tarball now contains doctest-mode and pycomplete
I have left these out of this package for now. If anyone wants them,
let me know

emacs20 is not supported since it relies on ansi-color which
is missing
