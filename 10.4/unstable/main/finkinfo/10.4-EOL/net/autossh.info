DescDetail: <<
autossh is a program to start an instance of ssh and monitor it,
restarting it as necessary (should it die or stop passing traffic). The
idea comes from rstunnel (Reliable SSH Tunnel), but was re-implemented in
C. Connection monitoring is done using a loop of port forwardings. It
backs off on the rate of connection attempts when experiencing rapid
failures such as the connection being refused.
