Description: AMQP Messaging for Python and Django

DescDetail: <<
carrot is an AMQP messaging queue framework. AMQP is the Advanced
Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol for message
orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security.

The aim of carrot is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible
by providing a high-level interface for producing and consuming
messages. At the same time it is a goal to re-use what is already
available as much as possible.

carrot has pluggable messaging back-ends, so it is possible to support
several messaging systems. Currently, there is support for AMQP
(py-amqplib, pika), STOMP (python-stomp). There's also an in-memory
backend for testing purposes, using the Python queue module.

Several AMQP message broker implementations exists, including
RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ and Apache ActiveMQ. You'll need to have one of these
installed, personally we've been using RabbitMQ.
