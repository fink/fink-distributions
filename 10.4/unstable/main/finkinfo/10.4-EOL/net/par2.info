Description: Parity Archive Volume Set II
DescDetail: <<
The idea behind this project is to provide a tool to apply the
data-recovery capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting
and recovery of multi-part archives on Usenet. Current filespec and
clients support the 'Reed-Soloman Code' implementation that allows for
recovery of any 'X' volumes for 'X' parity volumes present.

The key to this mission is a clean file format specification which
provides all the necessary capabilities for programs to easily verify
and regenerate single missing parts out of a set of archives.

We might just be able to make binary posting and downloading on Usenet
a little easier.  That's a pretty cool goal!
