DescDetail: <<
	aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are
	HTTP(S), FTP, BitTorrent (DHT, PEX, MSE/PE), and Metalink.

	It can download one or more files individually or from multiple
	sources/protocols at the same time and tries to utilize your maximum
	download bandwidth (by using multiple threads and downloading data from
	HTTP(S)/FTP, while also uploading to the BitTorrent swarm).

	Using Metalink's chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks
	of data while downloading a file like BitTorrent.

	There are other alternative applications. But aria2 has 2 distinctive
	features: (1) aria2 can download a file from several
	URLs(http/ftp/BitTorrent) and (2) If you give aria2 list of URLs, then
	aria2 downloads them concurrently. You don't have to wait for the
	current download queue to finish one file at a time anymore. aria2 uses
	your maximum bandwidth and downloads files quickly.

DescPort: <<
	Set ZLIB_LIBS manually to avoid a spurious -L/usr/lib.
	Set ZLIB_CFLAGS to point to system-openssl since it gets added first
	to CPPFLAGS and --with-openssl-prefix doesn't do anything useful.
