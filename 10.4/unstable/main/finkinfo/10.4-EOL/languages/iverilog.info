# Fink (1.875 and later, but not including 2.0) break the build.

Description: Icarus Verilog

DescDetail: <<
Icarus Verilog is a Verilog compiler that generates a variety of
engineering formats, including XNF and EDIF netlists for synthesis,
and waveform files from simulation. It strives to be true to the
IEEE-1364 standard.

A testbench is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtest

This package provides the latest stable release. If you need synthesis, you may
want to stick with the 0.8.x series in the 'iverilog08' package.

You may have both this package and iverilog08 installed at the same time.
<<

DescPort: <<
Instructions from macos.txt were followed, adapting them for the
Fink way of doing things.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
SetCXXFLAGS is used because CPPFLAGS does not appear to be honored (this
problem manifests itself as an inability to find readline/readline.h).
