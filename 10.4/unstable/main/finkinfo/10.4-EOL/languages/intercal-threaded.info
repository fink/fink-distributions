Description: Implementation of INTERCAL with thread support
DescPort: <<
Requires patches to the Makefile to install in the right place. The manual is in Postscript format and 
is in share/doc/intercal-threaded/intercal.ps. 

The code heavily depends on the old style of variable-argument functions, which was removed in GCC 3.3 and up;
it must be built using 3.1, and cannot be fixed without difficult rewriting.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
Links 'thick' to 'ick' in the bin/ directory for backwards compatibility.
<<

DescDetail: <<
An implementation of the language INTERCAL, legendary for its
perversity and horribleness. This version adds COME FROM and
multithreading for extra flavor.  Comes with language manual and
examples including possibly the entire extant body of INTERCAL code.
