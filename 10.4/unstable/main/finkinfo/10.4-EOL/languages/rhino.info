Description: JavaScript for Java

DescDetail: <<
Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java.
It is typically embedded into Java applications to provide scripting to end
users.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
The Rhino build file tries to download external JAR files; this is against
Fink policy. Because these JARs are already available through dependencies,
the patch file adjusts the build properties so that the dependent JARs are
used, thus preventing the attempt to download them.

A sub-build file also attempts to download a ZIP file from java.sun.com. The
patch prevents this, as well. However, because the ZIP file is not available
as a dependency, it is downloaded separately via the Source2 field. The last
half of the patch adjusts the sub-build file to ensure that the the necessary
search-and-replace operations are performed on the extracted Source2 files.
