The program Probe allows one to evaluate atomic packing, either within or
between molecules. It generates "contact dots" where atoms are in close
contact. Probe reads atomic coordinates from protein databank (PDB) format
files and writes dot-lists for inclusion in a kinemage file. Alternatively,
the packing information can be quantified and displayed in a table listing
scores for van der Waals interactions, H-bonds and atomic overlaps
("clashes"). Essentially the inverse of the Connolly algorithm, the approach
is to place a very small probe (typically of radius 0.25A) at points along
the van der Waals surface of a selected set of atoms and determine if this
probe also contacts atoms within a second "target" set. Probe provides a
flexible method for selecting the source and target atoms along with command
line flags for altering the probe radius and dot density. In addition, Probe
can generate contact surfaces within a set of atoms ("self dots") and even
"surface dots" where there are no nearby atoms. For a detailed description

Goodness-of-Fit: Small-probe Contact Dots with Explicit Hydrogen Atoms" J.
