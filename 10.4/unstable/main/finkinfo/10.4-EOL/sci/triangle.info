Description: Tiny but powerful 2D mesh generator
DescDetail: <<
 Triangle
A Two-Dimensional Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator.

Show Me
A Display Program for Meshes and More.

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay
triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and quality conforming Delaunay
triangulations.  The latter can be generated with no small angles, and are
thus suitable for finite element analysis.  Show Me graphically displays
the contents of the geometric files used by Triangle.  Show Me can also
write images in PostScript form.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Two binaries are installed: triangle and showme.
 The header file triangle.h and the object file triangle.o 
 that are needed for compiling your own projects with triangle
 are installed in %p/lib/triangle.
 Extensive documentation is contained in the source and help files
 in %p/share/doc/triangle as well as on the Web page
