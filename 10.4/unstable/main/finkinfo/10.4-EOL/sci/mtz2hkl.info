DescDetail: << 
mtz2hkl is intended to facilitate the transition from refmac5
refinement to shelxh or shelxl refinement. At high resolution refinement one
often starts with refmac5 and towards the end finishes with shelxh/ shelxl.

mtz2hkl is supposed to run with as little user interaction as possible and in
the ideal case creates an HKLF 3 or HKLF 4 file from just the filename.

The input file should be the mtz-file that refmac5 refines against.

To reference this program, please quote T. Grune: "mtz2sca and mtz2hkl:
facilitated transition from CCP4 to the SHELX program suite"
