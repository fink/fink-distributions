Description: Very capable VLSI layout CAD tool
BuildDepends: fink (>= 0.24.12-1), readline5, x11-dev
Depends: x11-shlibs

DescDetail: <<
Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley
by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter
language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license,
magic has remained popular with universities and small companies.

The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward
programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of
fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms
which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited
as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who
ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.

The 7.1 series has been retired, no further development is planned. 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Binaries are installed with suffix -7.1 to avoid conflicting with other 
versions.  Readline functionality is only statically linked, so magic doesn't 
depend on the shlibs being installed.  
Man pages are relocated to $(prefix)/share/man because $(prefix)/man 
is deprecated.
Most man pages in section 3 and 5 have been prefixed with "magic-" to 
avoid collisions.
