Description: Mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator

DescDetail: <<
Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator. Its code 
is based on three open source software packages: Spice3f5, Cider1b1 
and Xspice.

Spice3 does not need any introduction; it is the most popular circuit 
simulator. In over 30 years of its life Spice3 has become a de-facto 
standard for simulating circuits.

Cider couples Spice3f5 circuit level simulator to DSIM device simulator
to provide greater simulation accuracy of critical devices. DSIM 
devices are described in terms of their structures and materials.

Xspice is an extension to Spice3C1 that provides code modeling support 
and simulation of digital components through an embedded event driven 
algorithm.

Ngspice is, anyway, a little more than the simple sum of the packages 
above, as many people contributed to the project with their experience,
their bug fixes and their improvements. If you are interested, browse 
the site and discover what ngspice offers and what needs. If you think 
you can help, join the development team.

Ngspice is an ongoing project, growing everyday from users contributions,
suggestions and reports. What we will be able to do depends mostly on 
user interests, contributions and feedback. 

Ngspice is part of the gEDA project.
