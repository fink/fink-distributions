DescDetail: <<
Developed in the LogiCal project (http://logical.inria.fr),
the Coq tool is a formal proof management system: a proof done with
Coq is mechanically checked by the machine.

In particular, Coq allows one:
* to define functions and predicates
* to state mathematical theorems and software specifications
* to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems
* to check these proofs by a small certification "kernel".

Coq is based on a logical framework called "Calculus of Inductive
Constructions" extended by a modular development system for
theories.
    
Coq also includes
* a mecanism to automatically generate certified programs
* proofs of the specifications of these programs
* a documentation tool (coqdoc)
* dependecy and makefile generation tools for Coq
* a preprocessor for TeX files that include Coq commands (coq-tex)

This package provides the core coq tools, together with documentation for
the standard library; the files to build custom tactics in Ocaml are
available in `coq-dev'; the reference manual and some other documentation is
available in the `coq-doc' package; a graphical user environment is
contained in the `coqide' package.
