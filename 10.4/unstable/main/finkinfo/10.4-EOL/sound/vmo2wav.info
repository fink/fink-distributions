The utility vmo2wav is hidden in the SieFS (Siemens File System) project, which attempts to allow mounting of a mobile phone under Linux. Project home page: http://chaos.allsiemens.com/download/siefs-0.5.tar.gz
It didn't compile out of the box because SieFS depends on FUSE, which was not installed and does not HAVE to be installed for the conversion utility as such. However, ./configure did not want to continue without FUSE.
The solution: we simply fake the existence of the necessary file. The configure-script looks for a file .../include/fuse/fuse.h which is to contain at least the text "(*release)". Well, let's provide that than.
There is also a section on Endian-ness; it appeared that the converted files were not converted correctly on a Mac.
