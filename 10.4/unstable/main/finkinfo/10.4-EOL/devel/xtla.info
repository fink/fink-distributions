DescDetail: <<
XTLA is an Emacs front end for tla, the next generation of version
control software.

The main features are:
* PCL-CVS like interface for tla inventory 

* Archive browser. Navigate painlessly in archives, categories,
  branches, versions, ...

* Good integration in Emacs. Almost everything can be done from within
  the editor Bookmark manager. Keep the most frequently used arch
  locations in your bookmark buffer.

* Integration of ediff, Emacs's graphical diff tool. (Even outside
  xtla it's great, you should try it)
    - To view changes made in a local tree
    - To view and resolve conflicts after a merge.

* Interface to view missing patches from all your partners with a
  single command

*  An Emacs mode for arch related files (log files,
  =tagging-method)

<<

DescUsage: <<
put the following in your ~/.emacs file:
(require 'xtla)
<<

DescPackaging: <<
Use one of the automagically generated tarballs on the homepage
instead of doing a tla get ...  the {arch} directory for this thing is
huge, and there is no reason to bloat the tarball with it if it isn't
necessary.  Another advantage is that the snapshots are autoconf'd.
