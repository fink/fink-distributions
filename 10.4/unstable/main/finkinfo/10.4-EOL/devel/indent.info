Description: C language source code formatting program
DescDetail: <<
GNU indent changes the appearance of a C program by inserting or
deleting whitespace according to a plethora of options.  Some
canned styles of formatting are supported as well.  GNU indent is
a descendant of BSD indent.

GNU indent does NOT work for C++, if it does for you then you're
just lucky.  Don't ask for support for C++.
