DescDetail: << 
A collection of useful shell scripts for working with the GNU Arch (tla)
revision control system.
<<

DescUsage: << 
The main user commands in tla-tools are: 

tla-switch 
   Switches an arch project tree's current branch to another branch,
   changing the actual source files to match (unlike the builtin tla
   command tla set-tree-version)

tla-fork  
   Makes a new arch branch forking off the current branch in a project
   tree, and makes that the tree's current branch.

tla-cvs-sync 
   Does bi-directional gatewaying of an arch branch with a CVS branch.

tla-svn-sync
   Does bi-directional gatewaying of an arch branch with a Subversion
   branch.

tla-update-ids
   Goes through a project tree, and automatically adds or updates
   taglines and explicit id-tags.

tla-file-log
   Outputs arch changeset logs which affect a specified file. 

tla-fix-changelog-conflicts
   Looks through a project tree for ChangeLog.rej files (containing
   conflicts from merging changes to the ChangeLog file), and tries to
   automatically fix them up, using a simple rule.

tla-copy-changes  
   Copies changesets from one arch branch to another. 

tla-partner  
   Runs a tla command using the "partner version" of a project tree
   (defined by the contents of the file {arch}/+partner).

Some other handy commands include: 

tla-changelogs-to-log
   Turns any changes in (GNU-style) ChangeLog files in a project tree
   into a single log text appropriate for including in a tla commit
   log.

tla-commit-merge
   Does a tla commit with a log text appropriate for a merge: the
   Summary: line mentions the merged version, and the body is the
   output of tla log-for-merge filtered through tla-abbrev-merge-log.

tla-abbrev-merge-log
   A filter for the output of tla log-for-merge which replace
   repetitive sequences of entries with an abbreviated form.

tla-log-to-cvs-log
   Converts an arch changeset commit log into a compact form suitable
   for including in a CVS commit log.

tla-fork-archive  
   Forks branches from one archive into another. 

tla-munge-archive-names
   Destructively modify an arch archive to change the names of arch
   categories/branches/versions

Patch is just the license.

Source fetched by doing the following with tla:
tla register-archive http://sourcecontrol.net/~miles/miles@gnu.org--gnu-2004
tla get miles@gnu.org--gnu-2004/tla-tools--devo--0

Figuring out what to put for fink's version field is a bit of a
challenge, as there isn't something that can be easily identified as a
simple upstream version.  This seems the best option:

upstream-version.archive-year.patch-number
0.2004.p67

Debian pacakges tla-tools with a version like this: 2004.0.patch.67,
which seems backwards and a little wasteful of space -- it would be
nice to keep the version under 10 chars in length, so a ``fink list''
shows the whole thing.
