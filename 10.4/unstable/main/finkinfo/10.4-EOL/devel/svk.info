DescDetail: <<
SVK is a decentralized version control system based on Subversion (svn).
Subversion aims to take over the CVS user base, while svk attempts to
take over the others - including people who already switched to other scm, and
people who had not started using scm. It is written in Perl and is using
subversion's underlying filesystem. For more information plase see the web site
at http://svk.elixus.org/

be set. Otherwise the tests would fail with an 'Too many open files' error.
