Description: Cross-platform implementation of Zeroconf 
DescDetail: <<
Branded as Rendezvous(tm) by Apple Computer, Inc., Zeroconf standardizes 
networking protocols for delivering hassle-free ad-hoc networking, 
service discovery and IP configuration. This ease of use, enjoyed 
by users of Mac OS X, is now available as an SDK for Windows 2000/XP 
and many flavors of Unix. Howl allows software developers to easily 
embed Zeroconf functionality in their applications, making cumbersome 
and error-prone network configuration tasks seem so five minutes ago. 
Give your users what they want. Give them simple, elegant networking. 
Give them Howl.

Howl is open-source and royalty-free. We ask only that any fixes or 
improvements you make are fed back to us so we can ensure that we provide 
the most stable, best-quality cross-platform software for 
Zeroconf/Rendezvous networking.
<<
DescPort: <<
  jfm added a patch (from darwinports) to ensure that esp.
  _sw_salt_lock and _sw_salt_unlock are well defined, else eg the
  build of gnome-vfs2 in exp/gnome2.8 goes wrong (same with current
  version) in 1.0.0-11.

  dmacks patched how configure defines PLATFORM_LIBS so we don't get a
  .pc file that confuses pkg-config and to link libhowl against its
  dependent framework.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  dmacks moved the dev files from libhowl and libhowl-shlibs to
  libhowl-dev and added DocFiles to all pkgs in the family in 1.0.0-11
  and removed the now-unused libhowl bundle in 1.0.0-16.
<<
DescUsage: <<
  None of the components that have manpages are installed, so there
  are no manpages at all. The API has docs in %p/share/doc/howl (part
  of the libhowl-dev package).
