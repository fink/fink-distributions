DescDetail: <<
Avalon-Framework is a small but vital jar file distributed by the Avalon
project, and some associated documentation. Avalon-Framework (often
abbreviated as AF, or even AF4 for version 4 of the framework) defines several
"lifecycle interfaces" that provide a common way for components to be created,
initialized, configured, started, etcetera.
