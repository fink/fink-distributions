DescDetail: <<
Welcome to the webpage for libhid, a user-space HID access library written in
C. It provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact with USB HID
devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based on libusb,
thus it requires no HID support in the kernel. Furthermore, it aims to support
all operating system supported by libusb: Linux, BSD, OS X, and Windows.

libhid is still under development and it does not have a proper homepage (if
you want to write one, please contact us!). Until one is ready, you are
welcome to download the software and try it out, it should be easy to use if
you have some knowledge of C and are willing to read someone else's
code. Documentation does not yet exist, but we are working to provide it using
Doxygen (again, if you want to help, please contact us!).

It is also possible to use libhid with Python and SWIG, but this package is
not currently built to support them.
