###
Description: ANSI C Library for Direct PDF Generation
DescDetail: <<
  ClibPDF is a library of ANSI C functions, distributed as source code,
  for creating PDF files directly via C language programs without relying
  on any Adobe Acrobat(R) tools and related products. It is free for
  private, non-profit use, but a commercial license is required for
  for-profit applications (Please see FastIO ClibPDF License for details
  or a Digest Version -- License Summary in Japanese). The library is
  suitable for creating fast dynamic PDF Web pages in response to user
  input and from dynamic data sources, and also for implementing
  publication-quality graph plotting, report or form generation. Since
  there is minimal platform-specific code, it is ideal as cross-platform
  graphing solutions with minimal developement efforts. Generated PDF
  files may be viewed and printed by auto-launching Adobe Acrobat(R)
  Reader or any other PDF viewer available free for many platforms. Note
  that ClibPDF is for PDF file creation only. It has no support for
  reading or modifying existing PDF files.
