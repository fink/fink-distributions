Description: GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
DescDetail: <<
 GNU MP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision 
 arithmetic on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Patch from Ben Hines to build libgmpxx, as of vers. 4.1-2.  As of vers.
 4.1.4-1, libgmpxx gets its own splitoff.

 As of vers. 4.2, mpfr is a separate library, available in fink as the 
 libmpfr1 package.

 On powerpc, we need to set ABI=32 to prevent gmp from building 64-bit 
 libraries.
