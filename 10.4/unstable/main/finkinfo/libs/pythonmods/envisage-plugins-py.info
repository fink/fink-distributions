Description: Plugins for the Envisage framework
DescDetail: <<
    The EnvisagePlugins project includes a number of plug-ins for the Envisage
    framework that Enthought has found useful for building scientific
    applications. Envisage does not require that you use these plug-ins, but
    you may find them useful to avoid having to reinvent these particular
    wheels.
        * Workbench: Provides an application GUI window that supports views
          and perspectives, similar to the Eclipse IDE.
        * Action: Supports user-interaction command mechanisms, such as
          toolbars, menus, and buttons.
        * Single Project: Supports a project paradigm for saving application
          data, assuming an interaction model in which only one project can be
          open in the application at a time.
        * Text Editor: Provides a rudimentary text editor interface.
        * Python Shell: Provides an interactive Python shell within a
          Workbench-based application.
        * Debug: Provides the Frame Based Inspector from the ETSDevTools
          project as an Envisage plug-in.
