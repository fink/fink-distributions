# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
The PyObjC package provides the glue needed to interface the Python
interpreter with the Objective-C language.  At its core is the 'objc'
module makes Objective-C objects and classes available as first-class
Python citizens.  It is not only possible to use Objective-C objects
but you can also subclass Objective-C classes.

To make it easier to use the core 'objc' module, this package also
provides a number of modules that are wrappers for the Cocoa
frameworks, such as Foundation and AppKit.  These modules not only
give you access to the classes in these frameworks but also to the
functions and constants in those modules.

To test see windows appear on your Mac OS X desktop from Python
scripts, run some of the example scripts in the pyobjc-pyXX-doc
package.
