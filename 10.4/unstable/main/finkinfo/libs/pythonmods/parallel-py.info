Description: Simple parallel processing for Python
DescDetail: <<
parallel-python is a pure Python module which that provides a
mechanism for parallel execution of Python code on SMP (systems with
multiple processors or cores) and clusters (computers connected via
network). It is light, easy to install, and integrates with other Python
software. 

Features: 
* Parallel execution of python code on SMP and clusters
* Easy to understand and implement job-based parallelization technique (easy 
  to convert serial application in parallel)
* Automatic detection of the optimal configuration (by default the number of 
  worker processes is set to the number of the effective processors in the 
  system)
* Dynamic processors allocation (number of worker processes can be changed 
  at runtime)
* Low overhead for subsequent jobs with the same function (transparent 
  caching is implemented to decrease the overhead)
* Dynamic load balancing (jobs are distributed between processors at runtime)
* SHA based authentication for network connections
* Cross-platform portability (Windows, Linux, Unix)
