Description: Python DNS library

DescDetail: <<
 dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record types.
 It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates.  It
 supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.
     
 dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
 level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
 class, and return an answer set.  The low level classes allow
 direct manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.
