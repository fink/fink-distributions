Package: 3to2-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 0.1
Revision: 1
Type: python (3.1)
Description: Refactor python 3.x syntax into 2.x syntax
DescDetail: <<
	lib3to2 is a set of fixers that are intended to backport code written
	for Python version 3.x into Python version 2.x.  The final target 2.x
	version is the latest version of the 2.5 branch, though for the Google
	Summer of Code (TM) a later branch will be necessary for some of the
	more difficult fixers (or some of the new features with no syntactical
	equivalent in Python 2.5) that have been backported to the 2.x
	branches.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	Run "3to2" to convert stdin ("-"), files or directories given as
	arguments.  By default, the tool outputs a unified diff-formatted patch
	on standard output and a "what was changed" summary on standard error,
	but the "-w" option can be given to write back converted files,
	creating ".bak"-named backup files.
