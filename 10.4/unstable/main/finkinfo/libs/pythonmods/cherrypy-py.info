DescDetail: << 
CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented HTTP framework.

CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same
way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This
usually results in smaller source code developed in less time.

CherryPy is now more than three years old and it is has proven very
fast and stable. It is being used in production by many sites, from
the simplest ones to the most demanding ones.

Oh, and most importantly: CherryPy is fun to work with :-).
