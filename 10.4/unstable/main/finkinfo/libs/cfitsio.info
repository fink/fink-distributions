DescDetail: <<
CFITSIO is a library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and
writing data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data
format. CFITSIO simplifies the task of writing software that deals
with FITS files by providing an easy to use set of high-level routines
that insulate the programmer from the internal complexities of the
FITS file format. At the same time, CFITSIO provides many advanced
features that have made it the most widely used FITS file programming
interface in the astronomical community.
