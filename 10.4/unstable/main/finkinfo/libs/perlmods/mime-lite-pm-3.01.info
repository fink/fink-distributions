Description: Low-calorie MIME generator
DescDetail: <<
  In the never-ending quest for great taste with fewer calories, we
  proudly present: *MIME::Lite*.

  MIME::Lite is intended as a simple, standalone module for generating
  (not parsing!) MIME messages... specifically, it allows you to output a
  simple, decent single- or multi-part message with text or binary
  attachments. It does not require that you have the Mail:: or MIME::
  modules installed.

  You can specify each message part as either the literal data itself (in
  a scalar or array), or as a string which can be given to open() to get a
  readable filehandle (e.g., "<filename" or "somecommand|").

  You don't need to worry about encoding your message data: this module
  will do that for you. It handles the 5 standard MIME encodings.

  If you need more sophisticated behavior, please get the MIME-tools
  package instead. I will be more likely to add stuff to that toolkit over
  this one.
