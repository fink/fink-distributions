DescDetail: <<
This module opens a config file and parses its contents for you.
After parsing the module returns a hash structure which contains the
representation of the config file.

The format of config files supported by Config::General is inspired by
the well known apache config format, in fact, this module is 100%
read-compatible to apache configs, but you can also just use simple
name/value pairs in your config files.

In addition to the capabilities of a apache config file it supports
some enhancements such as here-documents, C- style comments or
multiline options.  It is also possible to save the config back to
disk, which makes the module a perfect backend for configuration
interfaces.
