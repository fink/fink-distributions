DescDetail: <<
This is an implementation of Term::ReadLine using the GNU Readline/History
Library.

For basic functions object oriented interface is provided. These are described
in the section "Standard Methods" and "Term::ReadLine::Gnu Functions".

This package also has the interface with the almost all functions and variables
which are documented in the GNU Readline/History Library Manual. They are
documented in the section "Term::ReadLine::Gnu Functions" and
"Term::ReadLine::Gnu Variables" briefly. For more detail of the GNU
Readline/History Library, see 'GNU Readline Library Manual' and 'GNU History
Library Manual'.

The sample programs under eg/ directory and test programs under t/ directory in
the Term::ReadLine::Gnu distribution include many example of this module.
