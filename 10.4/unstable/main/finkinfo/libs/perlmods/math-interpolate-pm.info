DescDetail: <<
This package contains two Perl modules, Math::IntervalSearch and
Math::Interpolate, where Math::Interpolate uses Math::IntervalSearch.

These modules contains several useful routines for interpolating data
sets and finding where a given value lies in a sorted list.

The first is a subroutine used to locate a position in an array of values
where a given value would fit using bisection.  It has been designed
to be efficient in the common situation that it is called repeatedly.
The user can supply a different set of comparison operators to replace
the standard < and <=.  For example, given a list (1, 2, 5, 8, 15)
and the number 9.5 it would return 3.

The remaining routines all are related to interpolating sets of (x, y)
data pairs.  They all take a list of (x, y) data pairs given another
x value, return a sensible y value using the list of (x, y) data pairs.
Three different interpolating functions are provided.  The first, called a
constant interpolator, assumes that the function being interpolated moves
in non-linear jumps from one value to another.  The interpolated value
for some value x is the y value of the neighboring (x, y) to the left of
the given x.  The second interpolator performs a linear interpolation
between the neighboring points.  The third interpolator is called the
robust interpolator and interpolates a smooth curve between all of
the (x, y) pairs.  To do the interpolation, it first calculates some
reasonable derivatives at the (x, y) pairs.  If you have measured your
own derivative information, you can supply it to the robust interpolator
and it will use it.
