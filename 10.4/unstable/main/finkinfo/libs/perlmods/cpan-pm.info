# Additional Info:
DescUsage: <<
Note: Various versions of the CPAN module may prefer to have the main
directory at ~/Library/Application Support/.cpan instead of the more
unixish ~/.cpan location. The directory itself seems the same and can
be via symlink in either direction.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	The old cpan-pmXXX-bin packages are re-incorporated
	into the cpan-pmXXX packages as of 1.76-3/1.94.2-1.

	module-signature-pm is in section:crypto; don't Depends so we
	can keep self in section:main

	module-build-pm only used for building so not Depends for fink
	because we're a package-manager that gets confused when CPAN
	is used to install modules directly

	CPAN::SQLite doesn't seem to be in fink yet.

	file-homedir-pmXXX is not available on 5.8.6, but cpan-pmXXX
	seems to provide usable (although slightly different) fallback
	if it's not found.

	-pm586 fails self-tests (seems unrelated to missing
	File::HomeDir in that perlversion)
