Description: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) modules
DescDetail: <<
  SOAP::Lite for Perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple
  and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) both
  on client and server side.

  To learn about SOAP, go to http://www.soaplite.com/#LINKS for more
  information.

  This version of SOAP::Lite supports a subset of the SOAP 1.1 specification
  and has initial support for SOAP 1.2 specification.
  See http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP for details.

  FEATURES

  - Supports SOAP 1.1 spec.
  - Interoperability tests with different implementations: Apache SOAP,
    Frontier, Microsoft SOAP, Microsoft .NET, DevelopMentor, XMethods, 4s4c,
    Phalanx, Kafka, SQLData, Lucin (in Java, Perl, C++, Python, VB, COM, XSLT).
  - Provides COM interface. Single dll (standalone [2.5MB] or minimal [32kB]).
    Works on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2K. Doesn't require ROPE or MSXML.
    Examples in VB, Excel/VBA, C#, ASP, JavaScript, PerlScript and Perl.
  - Provides transparent compression support for HTTP transport.
  - Provides mod_soap module. Make SOAP server with a few lines in .htaccess
    or .conf file.
  - Includes XML::Parser::Lite (regexp-based XML parser) which runs instead
    of XML::Parser where Perl 5.6 runs (even on WinCE) with some limitations.
  - Includes XMLRPC::Lite, implementation of XML-RPC protocol on client and
    server side. All transports and features of SOAP::Lite are available.
  - Supports multipart/form-data MIME attachments.
  - Supports circular linked lists and multiple references.
  - Supports Map datatype (encoding of maps/hashes with arbitrary keys).
  - Supports HTTPS protocol.
  - Provides proxy support.
  - Provides CGI/daemon/mod_perl/Apache::Registry server implementations.
  - Provides TCP server implementation.
  - Provides IO (STDIN/STDOUT/File) server implementation.
  - Provides FTP client implementation.
  - Supports single/multipart MIME attachment (parsing side only).
  - Supports SMTP protocol.
  - Provides POP3 server implementation.
  - Supports M-POST and redirects in HTTP transport.
  - Supports Basic/Digest server authentication.
  - Works with CGI accelerators, like VelociGen and PerlEx.
  - Supports UDDI interface on client side. See UDDI::Lite for details.
  - Supports UDDI publishing API. Examples and documentation provided.
  - Supports WSDL schema with stub and run-time access.
  - Supports blessed object references.
  - Supports arrays (both serialization and deserialization with autotyping).
  - Supports custom serialization.
  - Provides exception transport with custom exceptions
  - Supports Base64 encoding.
  - Supports XML entity encoding.
  - Supports header attributes.
  - Supports dynamic and static class/method binding.
  - Supports objects-by-reference with simple garbage collection and
    activation.
  - Provides shell for interactive SOAP sessions.
  - Supports out parameters binding.
  - Supports transparent SOAP calls with autodispatch feature.
  - Provides easy services deployment. Put module in specified directory and
    it'll be accessible.
  - Has tests, examples and documentation to let you be up and running in no
    time.
