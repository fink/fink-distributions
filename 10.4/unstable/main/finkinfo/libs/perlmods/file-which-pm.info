DescPackaging: <<
	There is an older unvarianted package, so cannot use
	update-alternatives to swap %p/bin/pwhich symlinks to a "real"
	variant-named file. The symlinks are created at install-time
	so dpkg doesn't know this package owns them but has written
	over the unvarianted pkg that owns them, so can get removed
	and leave us in a broken state. Guess we're stuck with
	swappable -bin splitoffs.

Description: Portable, pure-perl implementation of `which`
DescDetail: <<
File::Which is a portable implementation (in Perl) of `which', and can
be used to get the absolute filename of an executable program
installed somewhere in your PATH, or just check for its existence. It
includes the command-line utility `pwhich' which has the same function
as `which'.
