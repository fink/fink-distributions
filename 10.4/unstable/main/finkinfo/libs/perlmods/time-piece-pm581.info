Description: Perl module for object oriented time objects
DescDetail: <<
This module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions with
implementations that return objects. It does so in a backwards compatible
manner, so that using localtime/gmtime in the way documented in perlfunc will
still return what you expect.  

The module actually implements most of an interface described by Larry Wall on
the perl5-porters mailing list here:
