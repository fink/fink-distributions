DescDetail: <<
This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner.  It was
motivated by the "Module::Build" project, but may be useful for other
purposes as well.  However, it is not intended as a general
cross-platform interface to all your C building needs.  That would
have been a much more ambitious goal!
