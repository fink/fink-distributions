Description: Modules for reading config files and more
DescDetail: <<
AppConfig is a bundle of Perl5 modules for reading configuration files 
and parsing command line arguments.  This is a descendant of, and 
supercedes the App::Config module.  Functionality is extended over the
final version of App::Config (1.09) and includes many new features.  This
module has been developed and in the process, renamed, as part of an 
effort to unify the various Perl modules for parsing configuration files
and command line arguments.

AppConfig has a powerful but easy to use module for parsing configuration
files.  It also has a simple and efficient module for parsing command line
arguments.  For fully-featured command line parsing, a module is provided
for interfacing AppConfig to Johan Vromans' extensive Getopt::Long module.
Johan will continue to develop the functionality of this package and its
features will automatically become available through AppConfig.
