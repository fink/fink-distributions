I often get email from someone reporting a bug in a module I've written.
I email back, asking what version of the module it is, what version of
Perl on what OS, and sometimes what version of some relevent third
library (like XML::Parser). They reply, saying "Perl 5". I say "I need
the exact version, as reported by "perl -v"". They tell me. And I say
"I, uh, also asked about the version of my module and XML::Parser [or
whatever]". They say "Oh yeah. It's 2.27". "Is that my module or
XML::Parser?" "XML::Parser." "OK, and what about my module's version?"
"Ohyeah. That's 3.11." By this time, days have passed, and what should
have been a simple operation -- reporting the version of Perl and
relevent modules, has been needlessly complicated.

This module is for simplifying that task. If you add "use
Module::Versions::Report;" to a program (especially handy if your
program is one that demonstrates a bug in some module), then when the
program has finished running, you well get a report detailing the all
modules in memory, and noting the version of each (for modules that
defined a $VERSION, at least).
