Description: Quotes strings to pass them through the shell
DescDetail: <<
  String-ShellQuote quote strings so they can be passed through the shell.
  Each string is quoted so that the shell will pass it along as a
  single argument and without further interpretation.  If no strings
  are given an empty string is returned.

DescPackaging: <<
At various times, we've had:
  string-shellquote-pm    1.00-1
  string-shellquote-pm581 1.00-20
    Replaces: string-shellquote-pm <= 1.0-1
  string-shellquote       1.00-1
    Replaces: string-shellquote-pm <= 1.0-1
The perl-unversioned -pm here is current state-of-the-art, so we need
