Description: Integrate AnnoCPAN notes locally into perldoc
DescDetail: <<
 The annopod command-line enhances the standard perldoc command by
 including user-submitted comments from the live documentation at
 annocpan.org.
 .
 This package requires that you install annopod.db somewhere on your
 system.  See the AnnoCPAN-Perldoc homepage for the download URL of
 that file, or simply install the Fink package
 annocpan-perldoc-syncdb-pm-bin and add syncannopod to your cron.
 .
 If you like the annopod command line, I recommend you alias perldoc
 to annopod.

DescPackaging: <<
 This package originally depended artificially on Pod::Perldoc v3.14,
 Really, an earlier version (like v3.13 which is in the Perl 5.8.6
 core) suffices on all platforms except Windows/Cygwin.  So, we patch
 Makefile.PL to downgrade that dependency to make this easier to
 package.  However, that constrains us to just Perl 5.8.6.  It's
 *possible* this would work with the Pod::Perldoc v3.10 that comes
 with Perl 5.8.1, but I haven't tested.  Help would be appreciated on
 that front.
 .
 The various files in this distro are patched to add /sw/var/annocpan
 to the search path for the database file.
