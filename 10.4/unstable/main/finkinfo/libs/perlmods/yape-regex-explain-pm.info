Description: Explanation of a regular expression
DescDetail: <<
The YAPE hierarchy of modules is an attempt at a unified means of
parsing and extracting content. It attempts to maintain a generic
interface, to promote simplicity and reusability. The API is powerful,
yet simple. The modules do tokenization (which can be intercepted) and
build trees, so that extraction of specific nodes is doable.

This module merely sub-classes YAPE::Regex, and produces a rather
verbose explanation of a regex, suitable for demonstration and
tutorial purposes. Perl 5.6 regex structures like \p{...} and \P{...}
and [:...:] are now supported.
<<
DescUsage: <<

format in the usual places.

DescPort: <<
