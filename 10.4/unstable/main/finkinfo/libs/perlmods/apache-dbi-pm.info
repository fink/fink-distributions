# Additional Information:
DescDetail: <<
These modules are supposed to be used with the Apache server together with 
an embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl. They provide support for basic 
authentication and authorization as well as support for persistent database 
connections via Perl's Database Independent Interface (DBI). 

- DBI.pm provides persistent database connections: 
  - connections can be established during server-startup 
  - configurable rollback to ensure data integrity 
  - configurable verification of the connections to avoid time-outs. 

- AuthDBI.pm provides authentication and authorization: 
  - optional shared cache for passwords to minimize database load 
  - configurable cleanup-handler deletes outdated entries from the cache 

Apache::DBI has been in widespread deployment on many platforms for
years.  Apache::DBI is one of the most widely used mod_perl related
modules.  It can be considered stable.

Disabled default tests since they can fail under certain
mysql server isntallations.
2007-10-31: Re-enabled tests. Should now work. Let's see.
