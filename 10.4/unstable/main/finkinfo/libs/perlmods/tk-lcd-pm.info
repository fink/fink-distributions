Description: Liquid Crystal Display widget
DescDetail: <<
  Tk::LCD is a Canvas derived widget, based on a code snip-
  pet from Donal K. Fellows' Maze game. LCD symbols are dis-
  played in elements composed of 8 segments, labeled "a"
  though "g", some on and some off.  For instance, the num-
  ber 8 requires one LCD element that has all 8 segments
  lit:

      b

      -
  a  | | c
      -      <------  g
  f  | | d
      _

      e

  A Tk::LCD widget can consist of any number of elements,
  specified during widget creation.  To actually display an
  LCD number, either invoke the set() method, or use the
  -variable option.

DescPort: <<
  Had to disable 'make test' since it requires X11 to be running and with
  fink there is no real way to verify or enforce this behavior.
