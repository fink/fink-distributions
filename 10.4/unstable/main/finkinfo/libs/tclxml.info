Package: tclxml
Version: 2.6
Revision: 12
Description: XML parsing routines for Tcl scripts
DescPort: <<
One of the install targets tried to install directly into the
configure prefix. Patched Makefile.in to prepend the omitted DESTDIR
path.

For some reason configure cancels all ranlib if building shared. Patch
configure to always enable it and then patch Makefile.in to re-disable
it for .dylib during build and all during install (since .a already
done during build).

For some reason libdir is not being correctly determined so set it
explicitly.

Some of the tests/tclxml.tcl tests fail, but this appears to be due to
syntax errors within the those scripts.

This compiles a shared library but does not set the compatibility
version info, nor does it install a .la or the full set of versioned
and versionless links for .dylib files. The whole thing goes in a
private place in lib/ so not going to fix this nor make a -shlibs.
