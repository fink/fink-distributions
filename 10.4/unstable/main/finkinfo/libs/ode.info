DescDetail: <<
ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid body 
dynamics. It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform independent with 
an easy to use C/C++ API. It has advanced joint types and integrated collision 
detection with friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in 
virtual reality environments and virtual creatures. It is currently used in 
many computer games, 3D authoring tools and simulation tools.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
The patch script was suggested by Peter O'Gorman on the fink-devel mailing
list. It is necessary due to some strangeness in the way the upstream package
configures autotool for shared libraries. See:
