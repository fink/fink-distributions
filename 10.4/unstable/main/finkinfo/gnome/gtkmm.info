# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: C++ interface for the gtk+ library
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, it must be updated at the same time
 as a large collection of packages: gabber, gabber-ssl, gcdmaster,
 genes, glademm, gnomemm, gtkmm, libsigc++ and anything which depends on any 
 of them.

 dmacks patched gtk--.m4 syntax for more pedantic automake1.9
