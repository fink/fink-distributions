Package: pygtk2-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 2.12.1
Revision: 1
Distribution: (%type_pkg[python] = 23) 10.4
Description: Python bindings for the GTK widget set
DescDetail: <<
PyGTK provides an object oriented interface that is slightly higher
level than the C one. It automatically does all the type casting and
reference counting that you would have to do normally with the C API.
<<
DescUsage: <<

The original pygtk2-py binding set split into pygtk2-gtk-py and
pygobject2-py. You should use those packages directly, not this
upgrade-compatibility dummy package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Hard to propagate Type:bundle into SplitOff, so just touch a file manually
