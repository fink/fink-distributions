DescDetail: <<
Development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser), with more
liberal features policy and development style.

This is the ELinks tree - intended to provide a feature-rich version
of Links. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to Links, and to
test and tune various new features, but still provide good rock-solid
releases inside stable branches.
<<
DescPort: <<
po/Makefile ignores prefix= passed with 'make install' but respects
DESTDIR= so do it that way.

This pkg builds and uses its own gettext libs (should fix to use
fink's). In the mean time, that means we get non-package-specific
config.charset and charset.alias, so we remove those.

Fink has lua5 but elinks is written against lua4 so diable lua support.

Not going to require X11. For info about why it is needed at all, see
