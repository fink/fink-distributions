DescDetail: <<
Development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser), with more
liberal features policy and development style.

This is the ELinks tree - intended to provide a feature-rich version
of Links. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to Links, and to
test and tune various new features, but still provide good rock-solid
releases inside stable branches.

As of 0.11.2-2, "elinks" has ssl support and "elinks-ssl" is deprecated.
<<
DescPort: <<
This pkg builds and uses its own highly- and fairly-undocumentedly-
hacked gettext libs, so make sure to see *that* gettext's headers
before any fink or system ones that may exist.

Fink has lua5 but elinks is written against lua4 so diable lua support.

Fix general CPPFLAGS handling. See:
http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2006-November/001354.html

Fix configure *_CFLAGS propagation. See:

-rdynamic test is documented to be fragile. It incorrectly passes for
us, so just skip it.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Not going to require X11. For info about why it is needed at all, see
http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-dev/2004-January/000754.html

Define V Makefile variable to display actual compiler commands instead
of high-level summary.

Not gonna bother fixing the .h checking issues that lead to "present
but cannot be compiled" noise for netinet/ip.h and net/if.h

Make sure the internal gettext doesn't install charset files.

Rebuilding the docs uses docbook-utils, which has elinks as a
potential dependency. Circularity! We already have docs in the
tarball, so force configure to avoid looking for those utility
packages.
