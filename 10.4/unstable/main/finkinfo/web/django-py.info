Description: Python web framework

DescDetail: <<
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed and used over two years by a fast-moving online-news operation,
Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a
newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who
wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.
<<

DescUsage:<<
See http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/

If you developed for a version of Django prior to 1.0 (such as 0.95 or 0.96),
refer to http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.0-porting-guide/
<<

DescPort:<<
The documentation in the admin interface should work, now that docutils has
been split into -py* variants.

The install script was cribbed from setuptools-py.info.
