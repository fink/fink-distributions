DescUsage: <<
To use mapserver you either copy the directory or the file: 
 cp %p/share/mapserver /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables
or 
 cp %p/share/mapserver/mapserv /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables
You may, of course, add symlink to CGI-Executables after you edit httpd.conf
to have Options: FollowSymLinks ExecCGI.

DescPort: <<

Need to switch to libgeos3 soon.

The binaries are now also installed in bin so that they can be used
from the command line.  Should mapserver depend on apache2 and put it
into the apache2 cgi directory?
