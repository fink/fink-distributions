+.TH zope-z2 8
+.SH NAME
+zope-z2 \- The Zope 2 ZServer
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B zope-z2
+\fI[options]\fP \fI[environment settings]\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B zope-z2
+is the script that starts up a Zope 2 ZServer process. You can modify
+the configuration of the ZServer process with various command line
+options. Depending on the options, zope-z2 will detach the Zope process
+from the terminal, and zope-z2 will return after the process was started.
+.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP 12
+.BI \-h
+Print a help message.
+.TP
+.BI "-z " path
+The location of the Zope installation.
+On Debian systems, this is /usr/lib/zope.
+.TP
+.BI "\-Z " path
+[Unix only! This option is ignored on Windows.]
+If this option is specified, a separate management process will
+be created that restarts the Zope process after a shutdown (or crash).
+The process will record its process id in the file path. If path
+is a relative path, it will be used relative to the Zope location.
+.
+To prevent use of a separate management process, provide an
+empty string (-Z '').
+.TP
+.BI "\-t " n
+The number of threads to use, if ZODB3 is used. The default is 4.
+.TP
+.BI \-D
+Run in Zope debug mode.  This causes the Zope process not to
+detach from the controlling terminal, and is equivalent to
+supplying the environment variable setting Z_DEBUG_MODE=1.
+.TP
+.BI "\-a " ipaddress
+The IP address to listen on.  If this is an empty string
+(e.g. -a ''), then Zope listens to all addresses of the machine. The
+default is ''.
+.TP
+.BI "\-d " ipaddress
+The IP address of your DNS server. If you don't provide a DNS server
+(i.e. -d ''), then IP addresses will not be resolved into host names.
+If you have a DNS service on your local machine then you can set this
+to 127.0.0.1. The default is: ''.
+.TP
+.BI "\-u " username/uid
+The username to run ZServer as. You may want to run ZServer as 'www-data'
+or some other user with limited resouces. The only works under Unix, and
+if ZServer is started by root. The default (on Debian systems)
+is 'www-data'.
+.TP
+.BI "\-P " number
+Set the web, ftp and monitor port numbers simultaneously
+as offsets from the number. The web port number will be number+80.
+The FTP port number will be number+21. The monitor port number will
+be number+99.
+.TP
+.BI "\-w " port
+The Web server (HTTP) port. If this is an empty string (e.g. -w ''),
+then HTTP is disabled. The standard port for HTTP services is 80.
+The default is 8080.
+.TP
+.BI "\-f " port
+The FTP port.  If this is an empty string (e.g. -f ''), then FTP
+is disabled.  The standard port for FTP services is 21.  The
+default is 8021.
+.TP
+.BI "\-m " port
+The secure monitor server port. If this is an empty string
+(-m ''), then the monitor server is disabled. The monitor server
+allows interactive Python style access to a running ZServer. To
+access the server see medusa/monitor_client.py or
+medusa/monitor_client_win32.py. The monitor server password is the
+same as the Zope superuser password set in the 'access'
+file. The default is 8089.
+.TP
+.BI "\-p " path
+Path to the PCGI resource file.  If this is an empty string (-p '')
+or the file does not exist, then PCGI is disabled. If this is no absolute
+path, than it's relative to the Zope location. For Debian, the default
+value is '/usr/lib/cgi-bin/Zope'.
+.TP
+.BI "\-F " path_or_port
+Either a port number (for inet sockets) or a path name (for unix
+domain sockets) for the FastCGI Server. If the flag and value are
+not specified then the FastCGI Server is disabled.
+.TP
+.BI "\-l " path
+Path to the ZServer log file. If this is a relative path then the
+log file will be written to the 'var' directory. The default is
+'Z2.log'. 
+.TP
+.BI \-r
+Run ZServer is read-only mode. ZServer won't write anything to disk.
+No log files, no pid files, nothing. This means that you can't do a
+lot of stuff like use PCGI, and zdaemon. ZServer will log hits to
+STDOUT and zLOG will log to STDERR.
+.TP
+.BI \-L
+Enable locale (internationalization) support. The value passed for
+this option should be the name of the locale to be used (see your
+operating system documentation for locale information specific to
+your system). If an empty string is passed for this option (-L ''),
+Zope will set the locale to the user's default setting (typically
+specified in the $LANG environment variable). If your Python
+installation does not support the locale module, the requested
+locale is not supported by your system or an empty string was
+passed but no default locale can be found, an error will be raised
+and Zope will not start.
+.PP
+Finally, you can provide a list of environment settings in the
+form NAME=VALUE.

+.SH NAME
+zope-zpasswd \- Create a Zope superuser password file
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B zope-zpasswd \fI[-u username -p password [-e encoding] [-d domains]]\fP passwdfile
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B zope-zpasswd
+is an utility to create a Zope password file ('access') for the
+superuser account in Zope.
+.PP
+.B zope-zpasswd
+will create a file \fIpasswdfile\fP with a single line with two or three
+fields separated by colons:
+\fIusername\fP:\fIencrypted password\fP[:\fIdomainlist\fP]
+If this file is named `access' and put in the INSTANCE_HOME directory
+of a Zope instance, Zope will use \fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP as
+values for the superuser (administrator) account of that instance.
+.
+.SH OPTIONS
+\fIpasswdfile\fP is a required option in any case. Normally, you will
+want to name the file `access'.
+.PP
+If you don't provide any other options on the command line, zope-zpasswd
+will start in interactive mode and prompt you for all necessary information.
+.PP
+.TP 12
+.BI \-u, \-\-username
+Username used for the Zope superuser. In interactive mode, the default is
+`superuser'.
+.TP
+.BI \-p, \-\-password
+Password for the Zope superuser. If you don't specify encoding `cleartext',
+the password will be saved encrypted.
+.TP
+.BI \-e, \-\-encoding
+The encryption/encoding scheme to be used for the password. Possible
+values are SHA, CRYPT or CLEARTEXT. If you don't provide this option,
+SHA will be used. This is also the default in interactive mode.
+.TP
+.BI \-d, \-\-domains
+The list of domains the superuser can log in from. An empty string ("")
+means any domain is allowed. This is also the default in interactive mode.
+If you want to provide multiple domains, the names must be separated by
+spaces and enclosed in quotes.

+.TH zopectl 8
+.SH NAME
+zopectl \- A Zope ZServer control script
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B zopectl 
+[-I INSTANCE_HOME_DIRECTORY] \fI(start|stop|restart|force-reload|status)\fP [...]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B zopectl
+is an utility to start, stop, restart and examine a Zope application. 
+It is a replacement for Zope's start and stop scripts.
+.PP
+.B NOTE: 
+If your Zope installation uses non-standard paths and/or if you want to
+run multiple Zope instances, you can specify the INSTANCE_HOME environment
+variable to the
+.B zopectl
+script by using the -I option.
+.PP
+The 
+.B zopectl
+script returns a 0 exit value on success, and >0 if an error 
+occurs.  For more details, view the comments in the script.
+.
+.SH OPTIONS
+The \fIcommand\fP can be any one of the following options:
+.TP 12
+.BI start
+Start the Zope zdaemon process.  Gives an error if it is already running.
+Additional parameters will be given to z2.py when it's started.
+.TP
+.BI stop
+Stops the Zope zdaemon process. This is equivalent to the "Shutdown"
+button in the Zope Control Panel.
+.TP
+.BI restart
+Restarts the Zope process controlled by the zdaemon. This is equivalent
+to the "Restart" button in the Zope Control Panel.
+If the zdaemon is not running, it is started.
+Note that this doesn't restart zdaemon! If you need to restart zdaemon
+as well, use force-reload.
+.TP
+.BI force-reload
+Restarts zdaemon as well.
+.TP
+.BI status
+Displays the current status of the zdaemon and z2 processes.
+.
+.SH BUGS
+The process handling is not completely robust. E.g. "zopectl restart"
+and immediately "zopectl stop" will leave you with an single z2 process.
+Handle with care and be patient.
+.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.BR zope-z2 (8)
+.BR zope-zpasswd (8)
+.
+.SH AUTHOR
+The zopectl script and this manual page were written by Gregor Hoffleit
+<flight@debian.org> for the Debian project. Feel free to use, copy and
+modify.
