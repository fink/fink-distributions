DescDetail: <<
This is a multi-tabbed terminal emulation program based on aterm 
version 0.4.2. This terminal supports most of the features of aterm, 
including a small footprint, fast, and pseudo-transparency. It also has 
tabs, a la GMT (gnome-multi-terminal). Finally, it does not require 
gnome or KDE, just X11 libs.
