Description: Program for creating and studying hyperbolic 3-manifolds
DescDetail: <<
 SnapPea is Jeff Weeks' computational tool for mathematicians working in 
 low-dimensional topology. It is used for creating and studying hyperbolic 
 3-manifolds, and is accessible via Python scripts as well as through a 
 traditional graphical user interface.

 This package contains the (rather primitive) Tk GUI interface.

 It uses the improved Python interface by Marc Culler and Nathan Dunfield
 from http://www2.math.uic.edu/~t3m/
<<
DescUsage: <<
 There are two binaries in %p/bin: SnapPeaPython and SnapPeaGUI

 The SnapPeaPython command starts python with SnapPea already imported.
 The example from the SnapPeaScripting documentation can be started by

    cd %p/share/doc/snappea-py23
    SnapPeaPython
    >>> t = Triangulation('MyFile')

 For other examples, see the README file.

 The SnapPeaGUI command starts the GUI.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Requires the Fink python2, tcltk, and pmw packages to make the 
 GUI work. The SnapPea Python module is installed into the standard
 site-packages directory.
