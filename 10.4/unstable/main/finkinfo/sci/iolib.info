Description: Library of reading and writing chromatograms
DescDetail: <<
Io_lib is a programming library for reading and writing chromatogram
files. It includes support for reading ABI, ALF, SCF, CTF and ZTR files
and support for writing SCF, CTF and ZTR files. In addition it also
contains the Experiment File reading and writing code. Whilst not
strictly a chromatogram format it contains references to files that do
contain this data and hence provides a uniform programming interface
