Description: Command-driven interactive plotting program
DescDetail: <<
Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven interactive data and function 
plotting utility for UNIX, IBM OS/2, MS Windows, DOS, Macintosh, VMS, Atari 
and many other platforms. The software is copyrighted but freely distributed
(i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally intended as to allow
scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data. It 
does this job pretty well, but has grown to support many non-interactive 
uses, including web scripting and integration as a plotting engine for third-
party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under 
development since 1986.
Gnuplot supports many types of plots in either 2D and 3D. It can draw using 
lines, points, boxes, contours, vector fields, surfaces, and various 
associated text. It also supports various specialized plot types.
Gnuplot supports many different types of output: interactive screen terminals
(with mouse and hotkey functionality), direct output to pen plotters or modern
printers, and output to many file formats (eps, fig, jpeg, LaTeX, metafont, 
pbm, pdf, png, postscript, svg, ...). Gnuplot is easily extensible to include
new output modes. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
The bare 'gnuplot' package has most of the available options included.
Use the -nox variant if you don't want X11 support at all.
Use the -nogtk variant if you want X11 but not the wxWidgets terminal.

Upstream's default font choice doesn't work on case-sensitive filesystems, 
so we set the GDFONTDIR environment variable to /Library/Fonts, and the
GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT environment variable to be "Arial".  If you want 
a different setup, you can set these yourself in your startup files, or in
your invocation of gnuplot, e.g.

env GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT="Verdana" gnuplot
<<
DescPackaging: <<
PDF documentation has been moved to a separate package to avoid having to
BuildDepend on tetex.
Remove an %i/share/texmf-local that interferes with installing tetex-base.
Now includes lasergnu script as well as manpage.
As of 4.2.5:  Rather than use the "arial" font by default as upstream would 
have us do (from msttcorefonts), we'll set environment variables to use 
"Arial" from /Library/Fonts.
4.26-2:  Revert patch because it doesn't do multi-plot windows
properly

4.2.6-1:
Apply terminal patch from Derek Bruening <iye AT alum DOT mit DOT edu>

http://www.burningcutlery.com/derek/bargraph/#gnuplot-bug 

Thanks to Andreas Schiffler <aschiffler AT ferzkopp DOT net> for pointing
this out.

DescPort: <<
Set DIST_CONTACT to mark Fink maintainer as contact person.
Uses Per Persson's aqua terminal (installed via the aquaterm package).
gnuplot is a shell script that sets environment variables and invokes
gnuplot binary (renamed to gnuplotx).
Install the configuration for epslatex terminal manually, because the 
upstream build system runs kpsexpand and texhash.
As of 4.4.0:  switch to --without-kpsexpand because apparently upstream actually _checks_
for that now.  
As of 4.2.4-8, No longer uses fink's libedit because it seems 
to disrupt the ability to zoom plots in the X terminals.  
We'll go with the builtin "readline", so
if there are any license issues those are upstream's fault!

Before 4.2.4 Revision 8
Since GNUplot's licence isn't GPL2 compatible, apply patch created by 
Axel Thimm for The Written Word, Inc., to use libedit instead of readline.
Since we've thereby modified Gnuplot's source, under terms of their license
we've modified the contact information, versioning as shown internally,
(Fink's revisoning should count for external vendor-specific versioning)
and we've stuck a copy of the patch in the .deb
