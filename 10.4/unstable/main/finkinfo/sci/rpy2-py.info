DescDetail: <<
 RPy is a very simple, yet robust, interface to the R Programming Language.
 It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R functions
 (including the graphic functions). All the errors from the R language are 
 converted to Python exceptions. 

 RPy2 is a redesign/rewrite of RPy, providing not only high-level interfaces
 to R but also a lower-level interface upon which build custom high-level
 interfaces.

 Doesn't work with quartz graphics device (need a Framework build of python 
 for that).
