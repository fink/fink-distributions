Description: Math calculator and graphing package
DescDetail: <<
Genius is a calculator program similiar in some aspects to BC, Matlab
or Maple. GEL is the name of its extention language (stands for
"Genius Extension Language", clever huh?), in fact, a large part of
the standard genius functions are written in GEL itself.

What can it do?

* Arbitrary precision ints, multiple precision floats, using all the
  power of gmp.
* Rational numbers, stored as quotient and denominator.
* Complex numbers, stored in cartesian coordinates as usual.
* Automatic typing, no need to declare types of variables.
* Math-like-looking expressions, tries to be as much a what you mean
  is what Genius understands, up to a limit of course.
* Matrix calculations, with many related functions.
* Modular arithmetic, including inversions and modular arithmetic on
  matrices.
* A complete programming language. In fact large part of Genius
  standard library is written in GEL.
* Can output matrices in LaTeX, Troff (eqn) or MathML, this is I think
  a very cool feature that allows you to copy stuff directly from the
  Genius console to a document in LaTeX, troff or MathML. I in fact
  use this even to just enter matrices into LaTeX documents to begin
  with.
* 2D Function line plots, standard 2D graphs of up to 10 functions at
  once, with possibility to export to EPS or PNG
* Parametric plots, with possibility to export to EPS or PNG
* 3D Function surface plots, with possibility to export to EPS or PNG
* GUI IDE where you can edit and run/test your programs
* A plugin interface, not yet really used.

DescPort: <<
  Fix lots of libtool and automake misusage

  Plugin loading doesn't seem to work (not parsing the Name and
  Filename fields from the .plugin cfg file).
