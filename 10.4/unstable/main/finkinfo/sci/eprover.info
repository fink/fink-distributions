E is a purely equational theorem prover for full first-order
logic. That means it is a program that you can stuff a mathematical
specification (in first-order format) and a hypothesis into, and which
will then run forever, using up all of your machines resources. Very
occasionally it will find a proof for the hypothesis and tell you
so...

E's inference core is based on a modified version of the superposition
calculus for equational clausal logic as described in [BG94]. For the
case of pure unit equality (where both goals and axioms are simple
equations, not disjunctions of literals or conditional rules), the
calculus degenerates to unfailing completion [BDP89] extended to deal
with arbitrarily quantified goals as implemented in DISCOUNT
[DKS97]. Current versions offers a variety of literal selection
functions and can e.g. emulate the unit-paramodulation strategy
described in [Der91] for Horn clauses.

E can now also handle full first-order logic. It uses a standard
clausification algorithm to translate first order formula to clausal
logic. Both clausification and reasoning on the clausal form can be
documented in checkable proof objects.

The prover was intended to become part of a METOP-based version of
E-SETHEO [Mos96]. E-SETHEO now has evolved into a multi-paradigm
strategy parallel proof system, but E is still a cornerstone of the
system.
