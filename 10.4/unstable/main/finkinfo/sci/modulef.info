Description: Classic Finite Element Package
DescDetail: <<
Modulef has been used for many years in the teaching of 
finite element methods, but also in serious computations
in research laboratories.

From the web site:
The following capabilities are available in the MODULEF library:

Automatic generation and modification of two- and three-dimensional
meshes.  Specification of material characteristics or external forces
by sub-domain or boundary section.  Choice of type of finite element
method, for example, conforming, non-conforming, hybrid, or mixed.
For non-conforming methods the flow and stresses can be computed along
with the temperature or displacement, or separately.

The finite element library contains about 36 elements for thermal analysis
and about 61 elements for elasticity for isotropic and anisotropic materials
and 4 elements for magnetism and 2 elements for piezoelectric materials.

Linear systems can be solved using direct or iterative methods.
Solution methods for eigenproblems include inverse iteration, subspace
iteration, Lanczos and QR methods.  Solution of time-dependent thermal
problems and dynamic problems; variational inequalities; Solution of
the Dirichlet problem for a biharmonic operator by a mixed finite
element method of order 1 or 2.  Calculation of velocities and
pressure of a viscous incompressible fluid (Navier-Stokes equations).
Computation of homogenised coefficients of composite structures.
Decomposition of domains.

Several modules are available for the display of results,
interactively or in batch, for example to plot two- or
three-dimensional meshes, deformations, stresses, isovalues,
velocities and streamlines in fluid mechanics, etc.

DescUsage: <<
 There is an extensive on-line documentation at 
 http://www-rocq.inria.fr/modulef/Doc/GB/welcome.html
 If you want to browse this documentation locally (in English and in French),
 install the modulefdoc package.

 Before starting to work with Modulef, run the command

     setup_modulef

 in the shell from which you will be working.
<<
DescPort: <<
 This version builds the "English" language texts for the interactive programs.
 Some French accent is still visible ;-) 
 The French version could easily be built by removing the line
   s,^(LANGUAGE=),$1GB, ;
 from the CompileScript.
 
 The patch is needed for two reasons:
 1. Some loops have to be converted to integer variables to 
    make g95 happy. This is not needeed for g77 and gfortran,
    but is a good idea anyway.
 2. At some places, full path names are replaced by relative paths,
    because these are used as input file names for modulef commands,
    and there is a restriction of 80 characters for input command
    line lengths. This takes care of build directories with very
    long names.

    Uses gfortran now.
