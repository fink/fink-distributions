DescDetail: <<
Developed in the LogiCal project (http://logical.inria.fr),
the Coq tool is a formal proof management system: a proof done with
Coq is mechanically checked by the machine.

In particular, Coq allows one:
* to define functions and predicates
* to state mathematical theorems and software specifications
* to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems
* to check these proofs by a small certification "kernel".

Coq is based on a logical framework called "Calculus of Inductive
Constructions" extended by a modular development system for
theories.
    
Coq also includes
* a mecanism to automatically generate certified programs
* proofs of the specifications of these programs
* a documentation tool (coqdoc)
* dependecy and makefile generation tools for Coq
* a preprocessor for TeX files that include Coq commands (coq-tex)

This package provides the core of the coq package; a graphical user
environment is contained in the `coqide' package.
