Description: Box of tinker toys for topologists
DescDetail: <<
 This packages contains the two modules FXrays and t3m.

 FXrays is a small, fast C implementation of an algorithm for 
 finding extremal rays of polyhedral cones with filtering. 
 It is intended to be used to find embedded normal surfaces 
 in triangulated 3-manifolds.

 T3m is a box of tinker toys for topologists. Use it for 
 studying triangulations of 3-manifolds at the Python prompt. 
 It is written entirely in Python, so you can take it apart 
 and put it back together your own way.

 T3m uses FXrays and SnapPeaPython. 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Uses Fink's python23 and snappea-py23, hence implicit dependencies
 on tcltk and X11.
