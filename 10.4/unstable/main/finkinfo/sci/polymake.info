Version: 2.2
Revision: 14

Description: Framework for experimental discrete geometry
DescDetail: <<
Polymake is a versatile framework for experimental discrete geometry.
The standard distribution contains tool collections for the algorithmic
treatment of polytopes and polyhedra, polyhedral surfaces,
and finite simplicial complexes.
It offers an unified interface to a wide variety of algorithms
and free software packages from the computational geometry field,
such as convex hull computation or visualization tools.

Polymake is highly adaptable to individual needs.  In particular, it
has a C++/perl interface which allows the user to bind his/her own
algorithms into the common framework.

DescPackaging: <<
The package structure is as follows:

The head package polymake is an almost empty placeholder.  It contains the documentation only.
It depends on the package polymake-common, which consists of compiled C++ programs and text files,
as well as on the little perl-dependent packages polymake-pmNNN.

In order to run polymake, one polymake-pm package is needed, which matches exactly the
current system perl version.

However, in order to build polymake, one must install all perl
versions that are supported by Fink.  In the current tree for MacOS 10.4
there is only one perl, namely 5.8.6.

Should a new version come in action, or an old one be declared obsolete,
all version enumerations occuring in this file have to be updated
(including this description!)
