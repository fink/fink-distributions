DescDetail: <<
Gpivtools is a package that contains command-line driven programs for the
so-called (Digital) Particle Image Velocimetry technique (PIV). The programs
perform image evaluation, resulting into a velocity field of the flow,
validation programs and post-processing programs to manipulate the data or to
extract information from the data (statistics, derivatives). There are some
additional programs and scripts for data and image format conversions,
chain-processing, batch-processing and for generating graphical output. Though
the command-line driven tools are mainly intended for non-graphic processing,
its outputs may be visualized in a graphical way by displaying with the aid of
gnuplot. A Graphic User Interface program (Gpiv) is available in a separate
package. This program controls all the processes interactively and displays its
results in a more advanced way.
