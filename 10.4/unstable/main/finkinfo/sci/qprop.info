Description: Propeller + motor performance analysis
DescDetail: <<
  QPROP is an analysis program for predicting the performance 
  of propeller-motor combinations.  Its intent is to provide 
  an alternative to the existing prop/motor simulation programs, 
  which use relatively simple propeller models, and assume 
  a brushed DC motor type.  QPROP has a relatively sophisticated 
  and accurate prop aerodynamic model, and a general motor model 
  which can be implemented via a user-supplied subroutine 
  if necessary.
  
  The companion program QMIL generates propeller geometries
  for the Minimum Induced Loss (MIL) condition.  It can also
  generated windmill geometries for the MIL or Maximum Total Power
  (MTP) conditions.  See the qmil_doc.txt document for more info.

  Note: The qprop_theory.pdf file reference in the README is no
  longer included in the package, but is still available from
  qprop's home page.
