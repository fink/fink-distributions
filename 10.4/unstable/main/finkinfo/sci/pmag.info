Description: Paleomagnetic analysis tools
DescDetail: <<

This package provides a large range of command line tools for
analyzing paleomagnetic data sets.  It is also good for analyzing any
set of 3d directional measurements in any field.  Produces postscript
output via the plotxy program by Bob Parker which is included here. 

For detailed explanations of the whole package and theory, see
"Paleomagnetic Principles and Practice" by Lisa Tauxe.  The new
version of this book is now available on the web for free at:

  http://magician.ucsd.edu/~ltauxe/sio247/

See also the Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC) for the
paleomagnetic databases.

Note that this software works with the SIO Paleomagnetic data formats.
If your data is in LDGO or some other format, you will need to write
your own little converter.
