Description: A library and API for manipulating large SNP datasets
DescDetail: <<
  SNPFile is a library and API for manipulating large SNP datasets
  with associated meta-data, such as marker names, marker locations,
  individuals' phenotypes, etc. in an I/O efficient binary file
  format.  In its core, SNPFile assumes very little about the metadata
  associated with markers and individuals, but leaves this up to
  application program protocols.

DescPort: <<
  Still static-only. Blame upstream.
