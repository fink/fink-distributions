Description: Aerodynamic analysis
DescDetail: <<
  AVL uses an extended vortex-lattice model to perform aerodynamic analysis,
  trim calculation, dynamic stability analysis, aircraft configuration
  development, etc.
<<
DescPort: <<
  Had to use the alternate code in aplotmd.f, as the code using CLOCKX 
  gave undefined symbols error during the compile.  This must be a known
  issue, as there was an alternate, commented out code block to use.
