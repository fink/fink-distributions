Description: GTK+ - API documentation generator
DescDetail: <<
gtk-doc is a set of perl scripts that generate API reference documention in
DocBook format.  It can extract documentation from source code comments in a
manner similar to java-doc.  It is used to generate the documentation for
GLib, Gtk+, and GNOME.

DescPackaging: <<
	Formerly maintained by Masanori Sekino and Michele Garoche.
	Added libxslt-bin to Depends in order to get xsltproc, otherwise some 
	packages fail to build.
	Customized docbook-to-man, and tools not installed
	Apple's perl and python are sufficient, so make sure they are used
	Patch programs to avoid needing glib2-dev at runtime

	Install manpages for command-line programs (from debian)

	glib is used for self-tests only. Good thing, since gtk-doc is
	a BDep of glib2, gotta avoid dep-cycle!

	Disable PDF generator (avoid tetex dependency pile)

	Use OS X vim--sufficient for syntax-highlighting format
	without pile of dependencies. May get built-in eventually. See
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567135

	Hardcode glib's prefix rather than querying glib via
	pkg-config (otherwise need Requires:glib2-dev)

	liboil-0.3 prior to 0.3.16-2 installed a gtk-doc doc file that
	published the NULL token. Any gtk-doc doc file built with this
	old liboil installed will have its NULL symbol linked to
	liboil's gtk-doc doc file instead of leaving it alone as a
	external entity. This was fixed in liboil-0.3 0.3.16-2 and now
	gtk-doc >= 1.13-4 conflicts/replaces the buggy old liboil so
	that everything Just works.
	Likewise had libcamel-1.2.14-dev published gettext symbols
	prior to 2.26.3-2, so gtk-doc >= 1.13-5 does the same game
	with that old one.
	Packages can
		BDep: gtk-doc (>= 1.13-5)
	and know that these packages' incorrectly-public items will
	not contaminate gtk-doc documentation: gtk-doc will
	automatically uninstall those old things, and if user needs
	those packages, the more recent versions can be installed with
	no problem as usual.

	NOTE: some warnings during self-tests and/or doc generation
	perhaps at least in part because don't have latest glib
	available yet (would be circular dependency to require it)
