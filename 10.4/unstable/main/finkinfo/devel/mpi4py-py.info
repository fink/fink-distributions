Description: MPI for Python
DescDetail: <<
MPI for Python provides an object oriented approach to message passing
in Python. Care was taken to translate the syntax and semantics of the
standard MPI-2 bindings for C++ to Python. Any user of the standard
C/C++ MPI bindings should be able to use this module without learning
how to use a new interface.

mpi4py supports a variety of different MPI implementations. This package was 
built against OpenMPI.
