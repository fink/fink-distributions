DescDetail: <<
 It is difficult to keep documentation in sync with source code. One of the
 reasons is that documentation and source code are stored in separate files
 that usually also require different editors to edit them. ROBODoc solves
 this problem. Specially formatted documentation headers are extracted from
 source files, reformatted in HTML, XML DocBook, TROFF, ASCII, LaTeX, PDF,
 or RTF, and stored in a different file. This way ROBODoc allows you to
 include your documentation in the source code. You can edit the source code
 as well as the documentation in a single file with your favourite editor.
 This makes it easier to keep your documentation in sync with your source
 code.
 .
 ROBODoc can be used to document functions, methods, classes, variables,
 makefile entries, system tests, and anything else you can think of.
 .
 ROBODoc works with C, C++, Fortran, Perl, shell scripts, Assembler, DCL,
 DB/C, Tcl/Tk, Forth, Lisp, COBOL, Occam, Basic, HTML, and any other
 language that supports remarks/comments.

DescUsage: <<
 * First read the doc at %p/share/doc/robodoc/
 * The rtf format created works with AbiWord, just import the 
   file created by robodoc and create a table of contents with
   Abiword. It also works probably with OpenOffice, but not 
   with TextEdit, unless saved beforehand with AbiWord.
 * For generating pdf document from DocBook xml files, use xsltproc
   with the fo xslt stylesheet and fop:
   xsltproc --output api.fo pathtofo/docbook.xsl api.xml
   fop -fo api.fo -pdf api.pdf
   You may have to customize the stylesheet to get right toc numbering.
 * For generating html document from DocBook xml files, just give the
   right path to docbook.xsl:
   xsltproc --output api.html pathtohtml/docbook.xsl api.xml
 * Other formats from %p/share/doc/robodoc/Examples work right out of the box.
 * Apart the binaries robodoc and robohdrs in %p/bin, there are two files
   in %p/share/doc/%N/Contributions: robodoc.kaptn to create robodoc.rc 
   file with Kaptain; and robodoc2pod.pl to create perldoc.
 * You may have to install tetex and the desired dvi, ps, pdf viewers,
   Docbook bundle, and eventually Kaptain.
 * More information is available on the author's blog:
