Description: Fast library for floating-point convolution
DescDetail: <<
djbfft is an extremely fast library for floating-point
convolution. The current version holds most of the
speed records for double-precision FFTs on
general-purpose computers. 
djbfft provides power-of-2 complex FFTs, real FFTs at
twice the speed, and fast multiplication of complex
arrays. Single precision and double precision are
equally supported.
