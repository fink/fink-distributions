Description: Software configuration management system
DescDetail: <<
Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management
system. It provides a framework within which a team of developers may
work on many changes to a program independently, and Aegis coordinates
integrating these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

Homepage: http://aegis.sourceforge.net/
DescUsage: <<
Aegis provides shell initialization scripts to set up common command
aliases. Links are installed in %p/etc/profile.d so that fink will
automatically source the appropriate script for your shell.

Aegis also provides a web-based interface. To enable it, copy the
aegis.cgi script from %p/share/aegis/cgi-bin/aegis.cgi to
/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/.
<<
DescPort: <<
In its default configuration, aegis expects to be installed as the
user bin, group sys.  These entities do not exist on OS X by
default. The configure script is patched to pass root/wheel to the
Makefile instead. The Makefile explicitly sets the owner/group of the
aegis library and shared files. In combination, this results in the
aegis trees (under fink) having files owned by root/wheel instead of
root/admin.

Note: Setting the group to admin will not work due to aegis' security
checks, which enforce that the uid/gid of the user/group that owns the
system state files (in %p/var/aegis) is less than the uid/gid of the
repository and checked-out aegis projects.

There are minor link warnings when compiling aegis because libaegis/lock.c
defines a function (lock_release), which conflicts with a system
function (lock_release) declared in /usr/include/mach/lock_set.h. The
system function is included because libm.dylib is a link to the OS X
libSystem.dylib. The conflict causes a link warning, but ld makes the
correct choice in resolution.

dmacks--Miles of grodvi and other groff errors, so disable it.
