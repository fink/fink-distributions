Description: Beautifier/Reformatter of C, C++, C# & Java
DescPackaging: <<
 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
<<
DescDetail: <<
	Artistic Style is a reindenter and reformatter of C, C++, C# and
Java source code.
	When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use
both spaces and tab characters to create the wanted indentation.
	Since the NUMBER of space characters showed on screen for each tab
character in the source code changes between editors, one of the
standard problems facing programmers when moving from one source code
editor to another is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was
up to now perfectly indented, suddently becomes a mess to look at when
changing to another editor.
	To address this problem Tal Davidson has created Artistic Style - a
series of filters, written in C++, that automatically reindent &
reformat C/C++/C#/Java source files. These can be used from a command
line, or it can be incorporated as classes in another C++ program.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	Read the options in %p/share/doc/astyle.html or astyle --help. Then
set your preferred astyle flags in .astylerc or the
ARTISTIC_STYLE_OPTIONS environment variable.

If you want to use the class in your own apps, extract the astyle source
from the %p/src dir.
