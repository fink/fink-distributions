DescDetail: <<
When you start Emacs, package Session restores various variables
(e.g., input histories) from your last session. It also provides a
menu containing recently changed/visited files and restores the places
(e.g., point) of such a file when you revisit it.

To restore the variables, this package writes a session file
(~/.session) when you exit Emacs. The file includes the values of
variables which are automatically updated by Emacs during some editing
operations:

* Histories of user input. For example, strings used in a find/replace
  command, names of files you have visited, etc.

* Contents of registers, whether they are texts or buffer/file
  positions. Buffer positions are automatically converted to file
  positions.

* List of recently copied/cut text blocks to paste, global markers to
  jump to, and other so-called rings.

* List of recently changed files with their places and some
  buffer-local variables.

To restore the places of a recently changed/visited file when you
revisit it, this packages stores the places of a buffer in a special
variable (the list mentioned above) when you kill that buffer (this
includes exiting Emacs). Places are:

* Point (the cursor position) and mark (e.g., the opposite position
  when a region is highlighted). These places will be restored, but a
  region won't be made active.

* The position of the last change. A new command (bound to C-x C-/)
  can be used to jump to that position.

* The boundaries if only a part of a buffer was visible. Reopening the
  file will again restrict/narrow the editing operations to that
  region.

* Values of buffer-local variables. Useful for variables which control
  some temporary editing behavior, e.g., overwrite-mode.

As opposed to desktop.el and other packages, Session does not
automatically revisits all files from your last session, most of which
are not interesting anymore.
