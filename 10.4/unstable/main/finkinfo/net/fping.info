Description: Pings a number of hosts at one time 
DescDetail: <<
fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up. fping is
different from ping in that you can specify any number of hosts on the
command line, or specify a file containing the lists of hosts to ping.

Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or replies, fping will send
out a ping packet and move on to the next host in a round-robin fashion.
If a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of hosts to
check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or
retry limit it will be considered unreachable. Unlike ping, fping is
meant to be used in scripts and its output is easy to parse.
