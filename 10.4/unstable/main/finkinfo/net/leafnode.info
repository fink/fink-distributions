DescDetail: <<
 Leafnode is a news server suitable for small, limited-bandwidth sites
 with only a few users. Leafnode keeps track of which groups are being
 read, and downloads only articles in those groups. Leafnode has been
 designed to require no maintenance and to be easy to set up.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  During installation a symlink to an xinetd conf file is placed in
  /etc/xinetd.d This may be incorrect, but at time of packaging, there
  was no official workaround to avoid placing this file outside of the
  %p directory tree.

  dmacks adjusted PreRm/PostRm to preserve spool if pkg is only
  removed (purging nukes them). Acts like ConfFiles, but that field
  can only handle files (not dirs) and that are part of the .deb (not
  created at runtime)

  dmacks moved chown from Install to PostInst so that we are clean
  under --build-as-nobody
<<
PostInstScript: <<
chown news:news %p/var/run/leafnode

if [ $1 != "upgrade" ]; then
 ln -fs %p/etc/leafnode/leafnode.xinetd /etc/xinetd.d/leafnode
 printf "\n\n\nImportant: \tRead the instructions in %p/share/doc/leafnode/README-Fink \n\t\tbefore trying to use leafnode.\n\n\n"

PreRmScript: <<
# clean up and remove ourselves from xinetd.d
if [ $1 != "upgrade" ]; then
  rm -f /etc/xinetd.d/leafnode
  rm -f %p/var/run/leafnode/fetchnews.lck

# Clear out the spool dirs
