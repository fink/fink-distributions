Description: Messaging service for multicast and group communications
DescDetail: <<
Spread is a toolkit that provides a high performance messaging service that is
resilient to faults across external or internal networks. Spread functions as a
unified message bus for distributed applications, and provides highly tuned
application-level multicast and group communication support. Spread services
range from reliable message passing to fully ordered messages with delivery
guarantees, even in case of computer failures and network partitions.
Spread is designed to encapsulate the challenging aspects of asynchronous
networks and enable the construction of scalable distributed applications,
allowing application builders to focus on the differentiating components of
their application.
