Description: Fast remote command execution
DescUsage: <<
You can use `fsh' to connect to a remote system via a tunnel. If `fshd' is not
running with the approriate options, one will be started by `fsh'.  The exit
value of `fsh' will be the exit value of the command that is executed remotely.
   
The basic invocation syntax is:
    fsh [ options ] server command args...

Examples:
	make sure fsh is installed on both ends
	start a tunnel:
		fshd server.domain
	run cvs:
		env RSH=fsh cvs -d server.domain:/path/to/cvs/repository co module-name


See the info file for more information.

DescDetail: <<
The problem: logging in to a remote system with a cryptographic solution
such as lsh or ssh takes time, due to the computationally expensive key
exchanges that occur when the connection is established. It is common to
trigger a lot of remote logins while using remote CVS, which makes it
painfully slow compared to having the repository locally.

The solution: reuse the secure tunnel once it has been established. fsh
is a drop-in rsh-compatible replacement for ssh that automatically
resuses ssh tunnels.
