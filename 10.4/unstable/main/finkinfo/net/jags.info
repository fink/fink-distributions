Description: Windows Network Neighbourhood browser GUI
DescDetail: <<
Jags - Just Another GTK+ Samba Client

Jags is a Gtk+ based windows network neighbourhood browser. The program
parses the output from smbclient (part of the samba-package) and use this
to display a graphic view of the network. This program does the parsing
with help from shell-scripts. This means that it's easy to change the
functionality of the program.
