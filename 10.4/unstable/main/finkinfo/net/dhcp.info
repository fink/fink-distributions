DescDetail: <<
 The ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution provides a freely
 re-distributable reference implementation of all aspects of the DHCP
 protocol, through a suite of DHCP tools:

 - A DHCP server
 - A DHCP client
 - A DHCP relay agent

 These tools all use a modular APIB which is designed to be sufficiently
 general that it can easily be made to work on POSIX-compliant operating
 systems and also non-POSIX systems like Windows NT and MacOS.
 .
 The DHCP server, client and relay agent are provided both as reference
 implementations of the protocol and as working, fully-featured sample
 implementations. Both the client and the server provide functionality that,
 while not strictly required by the protocol, is very useful in practice. The
 DHCP server also makes allowances for non-compliant clients which one might
 still like to support.
