Description: Bittorrent client with enhanced curses interface
DescDetail: <<
  bittorrent is a tool for distributing files.  Whenever more than one
  person is downloading at once they send pieces of the file(s) to each
  other, thus relieving the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with
  many simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
  remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new upload
  capacity.

  BitTornado is the next generation bittorrent client built on
  the original BitTorrent. This client features an enhanced
  console/curses mode, lots of new features under the hood, and is
  generally one of the most advanced clients out there. Get this if you
  need to limit your bandwidth, or you want more control of your
  torrents. It does everything the original bittorrent does, plus more...

  This package only contains the curses interfaces, install the package
  bittornado-gui to get the GUI components
