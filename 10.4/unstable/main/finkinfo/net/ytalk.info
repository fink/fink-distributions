Description: Enhanced talk program
DescDetail: <<
Ytalk is a multi-user chat program. It works exactly like the UNIX talk
program and even communicates with the same talk daemons. Ytalk's
advantages come in it's ability to allow multiple connections.
<<
DescPort: <<
Ytalk has the option of compiling with or without X11 GUI support.
This version of ytalk requires x11 as it includes a GUI frontend.
If you don't want (or need) the GUI, then install the ytalk-nox package
instead. The two are mutually exclusive, you can only have one installed.
