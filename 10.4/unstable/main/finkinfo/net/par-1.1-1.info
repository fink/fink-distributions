Description: Parity Archive Volume Set
DescDetail: <<
The idea behind this project is to provide a tool to apply the data-recovery 
capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting and recovery of 
multi-part 
archives on Usenet. Current filespec and clients support the 
'Reed-Soloman Code' 
implementation that allows for recovery of any 'X' volumes for 'X' parity 
volumes present.
.
The key to this mission is a clean file format specification which provides 
all the 
necessary capabilities for programs to easily verify and regenerate single 
missing parts 
out of a set of archives.
.
We might just be able to make binary posting and downloading on Usenet a 
little easier. 
That's a pretty cool goal!
