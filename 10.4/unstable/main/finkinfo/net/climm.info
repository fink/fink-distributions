Description: Text/line based ICQ client with many features
DescDetail: <<
climm is a portable, small, yet powerful console based ICQ client. It
supports password changing, auto-away, creation of new accounts, searching,
file transfer, acknowledged messages, SMS, client identification, logging,
scripting, transcoding, multi-UIN usage and other features that makes it a
very complete yet simple internationalized client supporting the current
ICQ v8 protocol.
It now also supports the XMPP protocol as well as OTR encrypted messages.

It has leading support for (ICQ2002+/ICQ Lite/ICQ2go) unicode encoded
messages unreached by other ICQ clones.

A lot of other ICQ clients are based in spirit on climm, nevertheless
climm is still _the_ console based ICQ client.
