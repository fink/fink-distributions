## Additional data
##
DescDetail: <<
  Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
  protecting privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies,
  controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
  obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a very flexible configuration and
  can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. Privoxy has
  application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.

  Privoxy is based on Internet Junkbuster (tm).
  
  Privoxy is NOT a firewall.
<<
DescPort: <<
  Theoretically this should auto-detect libpcre and link it dynamically,
  but it seems a little wonky. I don't have time to fool around with
  this at present, and privoxy supplies its own statically linked copy
  of libpcre, so I've just gone with that for the time being. I'll add
  dynamic libpcre in a later revision.

  It would be more worth getting dynamic libpcre working if dynamic
  libpcrs (Perl compatible regex substitutions) was also available. I
  briefly played around with trying to port libpcrs, but it rapidly
  exhausted my knowledge base :) Maybe later when I have more time...
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  This is a full replacement for the old junkbuster package (the
  JunkBuster proxy no longer appears to be under development).

  This builds fine with both autoconf (2.13-3) and autoconf2.5 (2.54-2),
  although with autoconf2.5 autoheader complains about deprecated use of
  acconfig.h. We could force use of the Apple-provided autoconf (v2.52
  as of Mac OS X 10.2.4 + December 2002 Developer Tools), but there
  seems little point. If the Privoxy guys don't get their act together
  before this deprecated stuff disappears, I may at some stage have to
  add a BuildDepends: (autoconf <= x.xx).
  
  The make install target is explicitly stated as being broken in the
  current release, so I install everything manually (as they recommend)
  until this gets fixed.
  
  Technically this should probably install the pcre man page, but I
  can't see how to avoid a conflict with the libpcre package. For the
  time being I've left it out (it'll become moot once I update to
  dynamic libpcre anyway). I have included the pcrs man page however ---
  there's no libpcrs package for Fink yet, so it won't conflict with
  anything.
  
  Uses cron-service (anacron) to install scripts to rotate the log files
  weekly, and download the latest version of the default actions file
  from SourceForge monthly.
<<
DescUsage: <<
  You will need to configure your browser(s) to use proxy address
  127.0.0.1:8118. If you already have another service running on port
  8118, or if you want to serve requests from other machines (e.g. on
  your local network) as well, you will need to override the default in
  section 4.1 of the configuration file (<fink
  prefix>/etc/privoxy/config). Similarly, if you already go through a
  proxy run by someone else (like an ISP's caching proxy), you will need
  to configure proxy forwarding in section 5 of the configuration file.

  To start Privoxy manually, use the command 'sudo privoxy --pidfile
  <fink prefix>/var/run/privoxy.pid <fink prefix>/etc/privoxy/config'
  and to stop it, use the command 'sudo kill `cat <fink
  prefix>/var/privoxy/privoxy.pid`'. To create a startup item, run
  'daemonic enable privoxy' as root. The startup item will be removed
  automatically if you remove the package.
