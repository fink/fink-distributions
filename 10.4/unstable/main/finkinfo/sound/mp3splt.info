DescDetail: <<
Mp3Splt is a command line utility to split mp3 (VBR supported) and ogg
files selecting a begin and an end time position, without decoding. 
It's very useful to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to 
split entire albums to obtain original tracks. If you want to split an
album, you can select split points and filenames manually or you can 
get them automatically from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from 
.cue files. Supports also automatic silence split, that can be used 
also to adjust cddb/cue splitpoints.
