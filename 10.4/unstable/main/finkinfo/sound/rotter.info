Description:  Recording of Transmission / Audio Logger for JACK
DescDetail: <<
  It was designed for use by radio stations, who are legally required to
  keep a recording of all their output. Rotter runs continuously, writing
  to a new file every hour.
  Rotter can output files in servaral different strutures, including all
  files in a single directory or create a directory structure. The
  advantage of using a folder hierarchy is that you can store related
  files in the hour's directory.
