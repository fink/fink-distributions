# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: GNUstep (NeXT-like) Window Manager
DescPort: <<
The man pages must be renamed so that Darwin's man command can find
them.

The locale workaround in recent CVS versions of XFree86 requires that
every program is linked with libX11. Window Maker detects the
workaround, but doesn't add the link flags. So we add them to LDFLAGS
and LIBS.

Earlier versions by Christoph Pfisterer
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The GNUstep directory, in which applications like WPrefs.app reside, is
configured to be %p/lib/GNUstep/Applications.

Needs help to link against the right library.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Before you can use Window Maker, you must run 'wmaker.inst' to set up
the preferences files for your account. That script can also create
an appropriate .xinitrc file to start Window Maker as your default
window manager.

To use Window Maker with GNOME, leave .xinitrc alone and instead
select Window Maker in the Window Manager panel of the GNOME Control
Center.
