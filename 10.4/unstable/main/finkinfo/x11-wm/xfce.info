DocFiles: COPYING ChangeLog NEWS README TODO INSTALL
Description: Lightweight desktop environment (without taskbar)
DescDetail: <<
XFCE is a simple, light and efficient desktop environment for X-Windows. This
version does not have the taskbar enabled. For that, see the xfce-taskbar
package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
ConfigureParams places manpages in correct directories, sets 'data-dir' and 
'conf-dir' to correct directories.
InstallScript uses 'DESTDIR' to install files in correct directories, and 
removes COPYING file installed in incorrect directory.
DocFiles installs relevant documentation..
<<
DescPort: <<
 Need to fix static vs. nonstatic problem, but for now, use gcc-3.3.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Run xfce_setup to set up replacement files in the user's home directory, 
enabling xfce to starup when the user starts an X session.
