DescDetail: <<
 Cool screen effect which scrolls random lines of text like 'The
 Matrix', my fave movie. If you haven't seen this movie and you are a
 fan of computers or sci-fi in general, go see it!

 An X11 font is also included in the distribution =-) try CMatrix
 with the mtx.pcf font loaded in a transparent aterm...

DescUsage: <<
 You will need a terminfo file capable of displaying color. Visit Mac
 OS X hints for instructions on setting this up:

 If you are just running this in Apple's Terminal, i.e. no xwindows, you
 could probably download a TrueType "matrix" font and use that (please
 send me the url if you find one).

 My terminal is configured to use the font "#PilGi", a symbol font
 which looks nice with cmatrix (Jaguar only?), the window background is
 black with 17% transparency, and scrollback buffer disabled.
 Then try: cmatrix -fab
           cmatrix -fabx (for xwindows)
 Type reset to restore default term colors when you quit cmatrix.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The build process automatically looks for an X installation and
 tries to reconfigure itself accordingly but it doesn't recognise /sw.
 I don't use X, so I hope this install works correctly with fink!
 PatchFileed configure to remove all the font stuff.
 The -DHAVE_SETFONT forces the program compiles with x font support even
 though configure doesn't find a fink-installed X.
