Package: fortune-mod
Version: 1.99.1
Revision: 2
Epoch: 1
Description: Database of witticisms provides fortune cookies on demand
DescDetail: <<
 The fortune package displays epigrams selected randomly from a
 selection of fortune files. This is an enhanced version of the BSD
 program. The data files (which can be shared) are contained in the
 'fortunes-min', 'fortunes', and 'fortunes-off' packages.

 These are the machine-dependent parts of the fortune package,
 i.e. the fortune program and the programs used for generating the
 data files.

DescUsage: <<
 To see a new fortune every time a Terminal window is opened, add the
 following line to ~/.login or ~/.bashrc:

 /sw/bin/fortune

DescPort: <<
 * ld: Undefined symbols: _program_name: added program_name
   http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/recode/recode_17.html
 * implicit declaration of function `exit': added #include <stdlib.h>
 * Force build of fortune/fortune.man during CompileScript for correct
   Fink path insertion into man file.
 * gzip strfile.1 during packaging for the unstr man file symlink.
 * Splitoff as Debian does, to allow for future localized fortune
   packages or simply other fortune packages in Fink.
 * Depends: fortunes-min | fortunes | fortune-cookie-db to ensure the
   default choice is not the offensive set, does not work if
   fortunes-de is selected during building, because Fink incorrrectly
   sees it as a circular dependency, when really fortune-mod only
   depends on fortune-cookie-db [virtual] RUNTIME, while the building
   of any fortune-cookie-db DOES require fortune-mod as a
   BuildDepends (to parse the datafiles during their creation).
 * Also, Fink currently does NOT handle virtual package selection,
   such as: 'fink install fortune-cookie-db' (does not work) so the
   PostInstScript here should be updated whenever a new localized
   fortunes package is added in the future.
 * ld: warning prebinding disabled because dependent library:
   /sw/lib/librecode.0.dylib is not prebound
