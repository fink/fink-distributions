Description: Worms clone
DescDetail: <<
War is declared !

Have the mascots of your favorite free softwares battle in the Wormux
arena. Using dynamite, grenades, baseball bat and others bazookas,...
exterminate your opponent in a 2D toon style scenery and a funny
environment.

Each player (2 minimum, on the same PC) controls the team of his choice
(penguin, gnu, firefox, wilber,...) and must destroy his adversary 
using more or less casual weapons.

Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, Wormux is
pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn,
each member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to
his opponents.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Version 0.8alpha1 is packaged as 0.7.98.1 to indicate it's not quite v0.8 (0.7) alpha (98) and the first one (1).  Beta3 would be 0.7.99.3.

This avoids issues with '0.8alpha' being greater than "0.8" and having to deal with epochs.
