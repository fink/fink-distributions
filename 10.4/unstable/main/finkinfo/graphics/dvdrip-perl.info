Description: GUI DVD ripper and transcoder

UpdatePOD: true

DescDetail: <<
dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It
provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost
all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses the widely
known video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open Source
tools.

In the Storage tab, the mount point of an already mounted DVD has to be
selected using the "dvd image directory" browser., e.g. /Volumes/SHREK.
In the RIP Title tab, "Open DVD tray" and "Close DVD tray" do not work.
In the Transcode tab, only the ffmpeg transcoder is supported.
<<

DescPort: <<
As device nodes such as /dev/dvd are not commonly used on mac os x, using
the mount point of a mounted dvd makes sense to me. The patch lets dvdrip
use the "dvd_device" as "dvd_mount_point" if it does not start with "/dev/".
<<

DescPackaging: <<
dvd::rip uses fping in cluster mode but it's configure script does not
detect it yet, therefore this dependency is not added yet: fping (>= 2.4)

In maintainer mode, a perl test call xwininfo which fails.
