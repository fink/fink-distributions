DescDetail: <<
Stegdetect is an automated tool for detecting steganographic content
in images.  It is capable of detecting several different
steganographic methods to embed hidden information in JPEG images.
Currently, the detectable schemes are jsteg, jphide (unix and windows), 
invisible secrets, outguess 01.3b, F5 (header analysis), appendX and
camouflage. Stegbreak is used to launch dictionary attacks against
JSteg-Shell, JPHide and OutGuess 0.13b.

###
DescUsage: <<
There are man pages for stegdetect and stegbreak. If you wish
to try stegbreak on the first steganographic image found in the wild
(at http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/stego/abc.html), make sure "abc"
is in your dictionary.

DescPort: <<
v 0.6-1 (dmacks): new %v that works with gcc-3.3; patched to force
linking to included jpeg and file/magic libs instead of ones available
from fink or system (uses modified versions of these libs)
v 0.6-2 (dmacks): patch out redefined var so works with gcc4
v 0.6-3 (dmacks): cleaner handling of flags (global *after* local)
