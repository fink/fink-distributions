Description: Lablgl OpenGL bindings for Objective Caml
DescDetail: <<
LablGL is an OpenGL interface for Objective Caml. It includes support for both
Togl widget and GLUT, which you can comfortably use with LablTk and LablGlut.
Specific support for LablGL is also included in LablGTK.
<<
DescPort: <<
This port on fink uses GL facility provided by xfree86 or system-xfree86. An
alternative is to compile LablGL without tcltk support, with the option to
use native Mac OS X OpenGL and GLUT framework.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The patch file consists of Makefile.config which sets the fink specific
build-time parameters.
