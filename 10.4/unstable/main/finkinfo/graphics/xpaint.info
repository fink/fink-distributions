Package: xpaint
Version: 2.7.8.1
Revision: 2
Description: Image editor/painting program
DescDetail: <<
XPaint is an X Window System color image editing program which supports
most standard paint program options.  XPaint also supports advanced
features like image processing algorithms and layers. XPaint allows you
to edit multiple images simultaneously and supports a variety of image
formats, including PPM, XBM, TIFF, JPEG, etc.

Install the xpaint package if you need a paint program for X which is
relatively easy to use - and use "The Gimp" for more professional work.

Xpaint is now based on the Xaw95 widget set for a nicer look, and it
also adds a number of new editing features, such as user defined filters
and layers. Some examples of filter and layer codes are included.

DescPort: <<
Play many pathname games for imake.

Program mis-determines prototypes for randomizer functions (misc.h).
Since there is an #include for the header that contains the (system)
prototypes, just rely on that and remove the program's bad idea.

Convert to Xaw3d widget set (cf. Xaw or Xaw95).

Omit gccmakedep because it falsely assumes arch=i386.

Can't figure out how to supress installation of app-defaults symlink
from x11 standard location in addition to fink's ("actual") location,
so just delete it (if it gets created--might depend on x11 variant).
