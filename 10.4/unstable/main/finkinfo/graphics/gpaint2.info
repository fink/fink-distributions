Description: Simple, easy-to-use paint program
DescDetail: <<
This is gpaint (GNU Paint), a small-scale painting program for GNOME, 
the GNU Desktop. gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP, it is 
just a simple drawing package based on xpaint, along the lines of 
Paintbrush. 
This version is named gpaint2, because it is based on gnome2. It can 
be installed along with gpaint. 
Currently gpaint has the following features: 
Drawing tools such as ovals, freehand, polygon and text, with fill 
or shadow for polygons and closed freehand shapes. 
Cut and paste by selecting irregular regions or polygons. 
Print support using gnome-print. 
Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes. 
Multiple-image editing in a single instance of the program. 
All the image processing features present in xpaint.
