Description: High-level widget set for Tcl/Tk
DescDetail: <<
The BWidget Toolkit is a high-level Widget Set for Tcl/Tk built using
native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces.

The BWidgets have a professional look&feel as in other well known
Toolkits (Tix or Incr Widgets), but the concept is radically different
because everything is pure Tcl/Tk. No platform dependencies, and no
compiling required. The code is 100% Pure Tcl/Tk.

There are some problems here.

  'tclsh tests/entry.test' returns:
    ==== entry-1.6 configuration options FAILED
    ==== Contents of test case:
            .e configure $name [lindex $test 1]
            list [lindex [.e configure $name] 4] [.e cget $name]
    ---- Result was:
    0 0
    ---- Result should have been (exact matching):
    false false
    ==== entry-1.6 FAILED
    ==== Entry-2.1 Entry FAILED
    ==== Contents of test case:
        list [catch {Entry} msg] $msg
    ---- Result was:
    1 {wrong # args: should be "::Entry::create path args"}
    ---- Result should have been (exact matching):
    1 {no value given for parameter "path" to "Entry"}
    ==== Entry-2.1 FAILED
    entry.test:     Total   45      Passed  43      Skipped 0       Failed  2

  Drag&drop demo doesn't work (cannot drag) and tree demo is weird
  (new window opens with no contents whenever on that demo tab).

But everything else seems to work correctly.
