Description: Grep Debian package information
DescDetail: <<
The grep-dctrl program can answer such questions as
  * "What is the Debian package foo?"
  * "Which version of the Debian package bar is now current?"
  * "Which Debian packages does John Doe maintain?"
  * "Which Debian packages are somehow related to the Scheme
     programming language?"
and with some help
  * "Who maintain the essential packages of a Debian system?"
given a useful input file.

It is a specialised grep program that is meant for processing any file which 
has the general format of a Debian package control file. These include the 
dpkg available file, the dpkg status file, and the Packages files on a 
distribution medium (such as a Debian CD-ROM or an FTP site carrying Debian).
