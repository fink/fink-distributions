Description: Package dependency checker tool
DescDetail: <<
It does dependency checks, if you wish. It knows the difference between 
installed, new (and available) packages, and the relationship fields 
(pre-depends, depends, recommends, and suggests). (For example, the current 
packages list need not be read in unless you want dependency checks; you may 
already have done that and now merely wish an ordering). It comes with a 
Test::Harness test suite, to protect the world against my typos. Oh, it knows 
about epochs as well if your dpkg does. This could be the basis of mass 
compiling the packages on a new architecture, or to build a release from 
scratch. 

It creates associative arrays of currently installed packages 
(/var/lib/dpkg/status), and new packages (given a packages file at the command 
line). Then, in the checking dependency phase, for each package in the new 
packages list, it looks at the dependencies, and ensure that each dependency 
is satisfied in either the new list or the installed list. If the directive is 
satisfied from the list of new packages, that package is added to the list of 
packages to be topographically sorted. It understands Pre-Depends and will 
insert breaks into the sorted list to separate the installation process into 
separate runs as required to satisfy Pre-Dependencies. 

All this is a set of perl5 libraries, so people may use the API in their own 
scripts.

- Tests fail, disabled them.
- Switched /var for %p/var, making sure to avoid symlink 'duplicates'.
