Description: Processor for for maildir-format mailboxes
DescDetail: <<
maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail
boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting,
which means moving, copying, forwarding, and deleting mail according
to a set of rules. It can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but
instead of being a delivery agent (which wants to be part of the
delivery chain), maildirproc only processes mail which has already
been delivered.

DescUsage: <<

DescPackaging: <<
