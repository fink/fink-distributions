Description: US Flight planning program with GUI
DescDetail: <<
  Flyway allows the user to find and enter U.S. waypoints  (airports, navaids, 
  and fixes), then it calculates courses,  wind corrections, and travel times. 
  Information about the  waypoints is provided (including frequencies, 
  elevation, fuel  availability, and runway descriptions). The route data can  
  also be used to fill in an editable FAA Flight Plan form, fetch  basic 
  weather information from the internet, and display a very  rough map.
