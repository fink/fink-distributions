Revision: 1
Description: GNU interactive tools
DescDetail: <<
	gnuit (GNU Interactive Tools) is a set of interactive text-mode tools,
	closely integrated with the shell. It contains an extensible file
	system browser, an ascii/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer and
	some other related utilities and shell scripts.

	It can be used to increase the speed and efficiency of most of the
	daily tasks such as copying and moving files and directories, invoking
	editors, compressing and uncompressing files, creating and expanding
	archives, compiling programs, sending mail, etc. It looks nice, has
	colors (if the standard ANSI color sequences are supported) and is
	user-friendly.

	One of the main advantages of gnuit is its flexibility. It is not
	limited to a given set of commands. The configuration file can be
	easily enhanced, allowing the user to add new commands or file
	operations, depending on its needs or preferences.

DescUsage: <<
	Start by running the file manager, gitfm.
