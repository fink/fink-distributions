# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: DOS emulator
DescDetail: <<
 DOSBox emulates a full x86 pc with sound and dos. It's main use is to run
 old dosgames on platforms which don't have dos(win2K/XP/linux/FreeBSD) 
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Use --enable-core-inline for a huge speed boost at the cost of an increased compile time.

 -mdynamic-no-pic required to build on i386, okay for ppc, too.
 See: http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6856

 Agressive optimizations via -fast are enabled for a huge speed
 boost, esp. compared to the official OS X binary. Note that this
 implies -mdynamic-no-pic.
 In order to support all PowerPC macs, we add -mcpu=G3 when building
 on PowerPC.

 A patch updates the CoreAudio driver to the v2 API for 10.5 support.
