Description: FUSE ssh filesystem
DescDetail: <<
This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer
Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is
very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.
On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into
the server with ssh: "sshfs host: mountpoint"
<<
DescPort: <<
On OS X, I recommend invoking sshfs with the options
-ovolname="finder volume name" -oping_diskarb
