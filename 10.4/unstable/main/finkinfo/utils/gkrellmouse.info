Description: Gkrellm plugin - mouse odometer
DescDetail: <<
Simple plugin for gkrellm that shows you how fast your mouse is going
(in the chart) and the total distance in pixels it has travelled since
the plugin was started. It's pretty simple and mindless, and probably
shouldn't be relied upon to produce ultra-accurate data, but it gets the
point across.
