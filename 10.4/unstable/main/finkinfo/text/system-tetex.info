Description: Placeholder package for manually installed teTeX
DescDetail: <<
 Install this package if you have installed teTeX separately from Fink,
 for example, by using Gerben Wierda's distribution (see
 http://www.rna.nl/tex.html ).  The package checks to see if you have a
 valid installation of teTeX in /usr/local/teTeX.

 This package insists on a complete installation of teTeX: in order to ensure 
 that from Wierda's distribution, you may need to use the expert mode in
 i-Installer and install "TeX Programs (developer extras)" in addition to
 the standard install.

 Because of the complicated interaction between Wierda's distribution and
 fink, if you need to update this package or to switch between system-tetex
 and the fink teTeX packages tetex-texmf and tetex-base, you must first remove
 all packages which depend on tetex-base, such as latex2html. You 
 can reinstall them after the update.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 We put /usr/local/teTeX/bin/... at the end of the user's path to ensure that
 fink's install-info is used rather than the install-info found in teTeX.
 Starting in rev. 9, we also add /usr/local/teTeX/man to the MANPATH (which
 is set in init.(c)sh prior to loading the system-tetex profile script).
