Description: Cross platform file encryption utility
DescDetail: <<
Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility. Encrypted
files are portable across all supported operating systems and processors.
Passphrases must be between 8 and 56 characters and are hashed internally
to a 448 bit key. However, all characters supplied are significant. The
stronger your passphrase, the more secure your data.
.
In addition to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default overwrite the
original input file with random garbage three times before deleting it in
order to thwart data recovery attempts by persons who may gain access to
your computer.
.
Bcrypt uses the blowfish encryption algorithm published by Bruce Schneier
in 1993.
