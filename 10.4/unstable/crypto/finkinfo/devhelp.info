Description: API documentation browser for GNOME
DescDetail: <<
API documentation browser for GNOME 2. It works natively with gtk-doc 
(the API reference framework developed for GTK+ and used throughout 
GNOME for API documentation). If you use gtk-doc with your project, 
you can use Devhelp to browse the documentation.

Starting in 0.10-1101, the "devhelp" package is a place-holder to let user
pick which rendering engine to use (it's hard-coded and linked at
compile-time, not a swappable back-end).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  Devhelp needs mozilla|firefox|thunderbird. Fink only has mozilla and
  firefox and both are in crypto so this devhelp must be in crypto also.
