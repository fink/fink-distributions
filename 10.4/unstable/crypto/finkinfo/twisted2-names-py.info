Version: 0.2.0
Revision: 2
Distribution: (%type_pkg[python] = 23) 10.4
Description: DNS protocol implementation
DescDetail: <<
Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client
resolver library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box"
nameserver which can read most BIND-syntax zone files as well
as a simple Python-based configuration format. Twisted Names
can act as an authoritative server, perform zone transfers from
a master to act as a secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or
any combination of these. Twisted Names' client resolver library
provides functions to query for all commonly used record types as
well as a replacement for the blocking gethostbyname() function
provided by the Python stdlib socket module.
