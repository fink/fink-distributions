Description: Help browser for GNOME
DescDetail: <<
Yelp is a help browser for GNOME. The name Yelp was suggested by
Daniel Lundin. Yelp is pronounced the same as the swedish word for
'help'.

Starting in 2.12.2-1, the "yelp" package is a place-holder to let user
pick which rendering engine to use (it's hard-coded and linked at
compile-time, not a swappable back-end).

DescPackaging: <<
  Yelp needs mozilla|firefox|thunderbird. Fink only has mozilla and
  firefox and both are in crypto so this yelp must be in crypto also.
