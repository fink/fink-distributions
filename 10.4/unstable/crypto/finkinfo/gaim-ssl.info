# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Instant Messaging client (with SSL)
DescDetail: <<
Gaim is a clone of AOL's Instant Messenger client. It features
nearly all of the functionality of the official AIM client while
also being smaller and faster. Gaim also has plugins that let
you use ICQ, Yahoo, MSN, IRC, Jabber, Napster, and Zephyr.
<<
DescPort: <<
Had to set the optimizations down from -O2 to -O to work around an Apple gcc3 bug.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
BuildDependsOnly is false because plugins may need the headers.
