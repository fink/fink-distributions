Description: Text based tool for managing emails
DescDetail: <<
Re-Alpine is a fork of alpine, building on the alpine release from University
of Washington. Alpine was a fork/redevelopment of the older pine program.

Alpine is a fast, easy to use email client that is suitable for both the
inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of power users.
Alpine is based on the Pine(r) Message System, which was also developed at the
University of Washington. Alpine can be learned by exploration and the use of
context-sensitive help. The user experience is highly customizable through the
use of the Alpine Setup command.

DescUsage: <<
Don't forget to copy certs into the %p/etc/ssl/certs directory to use SSL.
