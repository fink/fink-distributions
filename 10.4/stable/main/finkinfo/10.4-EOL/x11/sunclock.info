Description: Sophisticated world clock for X11
DescDetail: <<
Sunclock displays a map of the Earth and shows which portion is illuminated by 
the sun. 
In addition to providing local time for the default timezone, it also displays 
GMT time,
legal and solar time of major cities, their latitude and longitude, sunrise 
and sunset,
and the mutual distances of arbitrary locations on Earth. 
Sunclock can display meridians, parallels, tropics, and arctic circles. 
It has builtin functions that accelerate the speed of time and show the 
evolution of seasons.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Downloading the enhanced earth maps is reccomended. Set options in 
~/.sunclockrc.
See manpage for list.
