Package: libwebp2
Version: 0.1.3
Revision: 2
Description: Library for manipulating WebP format
DescDetail: <<
	WebP is a method of lossy compression that can be used on photographic
	images. The degree of compression is adjustable so a user can choose
	the trade-off between file size and image quality.

	A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a container based on RIFF.
	Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use the WebP
	format to create smaller, better looking images that can help make the
	web faster.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Added upstream patch to enable building with gcc-4.0 on 10.5.
	Can be removed in next version.
