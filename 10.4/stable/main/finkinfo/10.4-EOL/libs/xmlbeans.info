Description: XML processing tool for Java

DescDetail: <<
XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a Java
friendly way. The idea is that you can take advantage of the richness and
features of XML and XML Schema and have these features mapped as naturally as
possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses
XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to
access and modify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using any
other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo just as
you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to
access your XML instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also 
API's that allow you access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset
fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself
through an XML Schema Object model.
<<

DescUsage: <<
For the extension feature using plain .java files, the jam-0.1.0-src.jar file
can be found in the %p/share/%n/jam directory.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
saxon-b is required for XPath/XQuery.
xerces-j is required for Resolver (http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/).
xalan-j is required for JAXP.
stax is required for JSR-173.

The purpose of the Piccolo JARs in external/lib is unclear. They are currently
not included in the Fink package.

The patch changes the build file in the following ways:
 * Alters the "version" target so that svn-client and ant-optional are not
   needed.
 * Alters the "saxon8.jar" target to prevent the unnecessary attempt to
   download saxonb8-6-1.zip.
 * Alters the "javadoc" target so that links to external JavaDoc packages are
   removed. This is unfortunate, but it's necessary to comply with the Fink
   policy that the Internet not be accessed during build.
 
The patch also alters the helper scripts (in %p/bin) so that the XMLBEANS_LIB
and XMLBEANS_HOME environment variables don't need to be set.
