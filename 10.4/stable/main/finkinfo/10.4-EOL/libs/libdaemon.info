Description: <<
Easy way to write UNIX daemons
<<
DescDetail: <<
Lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX daemons

It consists of the following parts:
  * A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization
  procedure of a process
  * A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log
  output to Syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage
  with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR
  redirected to syslog.

APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It
is not that simple to get it done right and code duplication is
not a goal.

libdaemon is currently used by ifplugd, Avahi, ivam2,
Nautilus-Share and aeswepd
