DescDetail: <<
 Leafnode is a news server suitable for small, limited-bandwidth sites
 with only a few users. Leafnode keeps track of which groups are being
 read, and downloads only articles in those groups. Leafnode has been
 designed to require no maintenance and to be easy to set up.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  During installation a symlink to an xinetd conf file is placed in /etc/xinetd.d

  This may be incorrect, but at time of packaging, there was no official workaround
  to avoid placing this file outside of the /sw directory tree.
