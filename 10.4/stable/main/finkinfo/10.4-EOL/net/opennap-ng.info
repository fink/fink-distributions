DescDetail: <<
OpenNap-NG is an Open Source effort to create a version of the 
proprietary Napster server. 
Napster is a distributed file sharing service which allows users to 
transfer files directly between their clients. A centralized server keeps 
track of all available files and provides clients the ability to search 
the index of available files. In addition, instant messages (private 
chat) and group chat services similar to IRC are also provided. 

Configuration files are derivative of sample.xxx files which are located 
in the doc directory. One 
must rewrite those files according to the OpenNap manual -- apparently 
not with the instructions in the files themselves, which 
is outdated. Then remove "sample." from the file name 
and place the files in the /sw/share/opennap directory. 

Note: for OpenNap to work, at least the config and user files must be
completed properly, with the user file containing at least 
one Elite user. 

Please see the manual.html included with the uncompiled package
for full instructions.
