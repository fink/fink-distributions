Description: Network exploration utility
DescDetail: <<
	nmap, a utility for network exploration or auditing, supporting ping scanning,
	port scanning and TCP/IP fingerprinting. It also offers decoy scanning, sunRPC
	scanning, reverse-identd scanning and others.
	
	Version 3.46 thanks to Alex Barclay <prozac@utulsa.edu>.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	On Intel Macs, installing psyco-py%type_pkg[python] will speed up the
	zenmap front end.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	ConfigureParams installs manpages in correct directories and uses installed
	version of libpcap.
	Makes use of the variant system introduced in Fink 0.19.2.
	
	Upgraded to 4.03 since previous version didn't work on Intel.
	Changed dependency from glib/gtk+ to glib2/gtk+2 since it would
	link to the later if installed. Added missing dependencies. Upgraded
	gettext to libgettext3. Added BD on system-openssl-dev since otherwise
	openssl linking varies. --danielj7
	
	Changed ConfigureParams yet more to ensure consistant linking.
	
	Use Fink-installed libpcre and libdnet instead of building our own.
	Now scriptable with lua!
	The old nmapfe GUI has been replaced with the python-based zenmap.
	zenmap should be run as root or with sudo.
