Description: User-friendly front-end to ssh-agent(1)
DescDetail: <<
 Keychain is a shell script which acts as user-friendly front-end to
 ssh-agent(1), allowing you to have one long-running ssh-agent process
 per system rather than per login session.
<<
DescUsage: << 
 Please study the documentation on the keychain website carefully
 since incorrect usage of this script may have certain security
 implications.

 Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.0:

 Support files are now stored in ~/.keychain so you will have to
 update your ~/.login script accordingly.
