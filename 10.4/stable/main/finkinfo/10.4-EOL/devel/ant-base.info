Description: Java based build tool
DescDetail: <<
Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell
based commands, it is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing
shell commands, the configuration files are XML based calling out a
target tree where various tasks get executed. Each task is run by an
object which implements a particular Task interface.

Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by
being able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo
-exec rm {}` but it gives you the ability to be cross platform. To
work anywhere and everywhere. And hey, if you really need to execute a
shell command, Ant has an exec rule that allows different commands to
be executed based on the OS that it is executing on.
<<
DescPort: <<
The chmod task of ant would fail with Java: UNIXProcess:forkAndExec: exec
failed: Argument list too long because apprently it tries to chmod thousands of
files in a single line of command, another solution is to set parallel to
false, which cause chmod to process one file after the other but then we get a
java.io.IOException: Too many open files. Conclusion was to use unix chmod in
InstallScript ;-)
Removed *.bat and *.cmd in bin
