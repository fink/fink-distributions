DescDetail: << 
XLisp-Stat is an extensible environment for statistics and dynamic
graphics written by Luke Tierney of the University of Iowa.  It
provides a variety of functions for element-wise arithmetic on lists
and vectors, linear algebra, basic statistics, and model building.  It
also provides tools for constructing dynamic plots.  The environment
uses a prototype-based object system for extension and can be
customized by writing code in XLisp, a lisp dialect similar to Common
Lisp.
