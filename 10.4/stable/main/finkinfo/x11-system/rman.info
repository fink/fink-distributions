Package: rman
Version: 3.1  
Revision: 1
Distribution: 10.4, 10.5
Description: Generalized filter for UNIX manual pages
DescDetail: <<
Takes as input man pages for a variety of UNIX flavors and produces as
output a variety of file formats.
PolyglotMan improves upon other man page filters in several ways: (1) its
analysis recognizes the structural pieces of man pages, enabling high 
quality output, (2) its modular structure permits easy augmentation of
output formats, (3) it accepts man pages formatted with the variant
macros of many different flavors of UNIX, and (4) it doesn't require
modification of or cooperation with any other program.
