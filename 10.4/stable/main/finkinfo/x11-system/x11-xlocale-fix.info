Package: x11-xlocale-fix
Version: 1
Revision: 1
BuildDepends: x11-dev

# not sure if 10.5's x11 is bugged but this hack seems unlikely to
# break anything, and it's nice to allow other other packages to keep
# their 10.5 vs 10.6 BuildDepends in sync
Distribution: 10.5, 10.6
# the bug appears fixed as of x11 in 10.7

DescUsage: <<
	To use, make sure %p/include/x11-xlocale-fix/X11/Xlocale.h is
	used whenever a source wants X11/Xlocale.h, rather than
	directly accessing the one that comes with X11 itself.

	One way is to pass -I%p/include/x11-xlocale-fix to the
	compiler. This flag must come before -I/usr/X11/include or
	other ways that would expose x11's actual header.

	Another way is to patch sources to #include the special .h
	directly (x11-xlocale-fix/X11/Xlocale.h rather than
	X11/Xlocale.h). Doing so only requires passing the usual
	-I%p/include, no extra -I or special ordering required.
<<
DescDetail: <<
	Use our own include-once guard token to avoid collision
	between apple's xlocale.h and some older versions of x11's
	X11/Xlocale.h (would prevent #including both of them). See
	upstream git commit d0cbf388919364fe6b5b9127f36426eb744090a0
