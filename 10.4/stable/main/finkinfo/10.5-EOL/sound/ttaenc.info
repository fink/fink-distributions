DescDetail: <<
The True Audio (TTA) codec is a free, simple, realtime lossless audio
compressor. Based on adaptive prognostic filters, TTA has compared
favorably to a majority of its popular open-source peers. The codec
was built to offer adequate compression levels while maintaining high
operation speeds.
