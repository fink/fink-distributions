DescDetail: <<
This package provides a command line utlity for decoding iLBC audio
into raw audio. iLBC (internet Low Bitrate Codec) is a FREE speech
codec suitable for robust voice communication over IP. The codec is
designed for narrow band speech and results in a payload bit rate of
13.33 kbit/s with an encoding frame length of 30 ms and 15.20 kbps
with an encoding length of 20 ms. The iLBC codec enables graceful
speech quality degradation in the case of lost frames, which occurs in
connection with lost or delayed IP packets.
