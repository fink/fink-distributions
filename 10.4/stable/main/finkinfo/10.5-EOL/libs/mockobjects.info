Description: Object-oriented unit testing framework
DescDetail: <<
Mock Objects is a test-first development process for building object-oriented
software and a generic unit testing framework that supports that process.
Mock objects give you:

    * A methodology for developing and using mock objects.
    * A core mock objects framework. This is a library of code that
      supports the implementation of mock objects.  It is based around
      a set of expectation classes for values and collections.  There
      are also various other classes to make mock objects easier to
      write or to use.
    * A default set of mock implementations for the standard Java
      platform APIs.  We have made a start on packages such as
      servlets, sql, and io.
