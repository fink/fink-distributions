Description: OpenAL bindings for Java
DescDetail: <<
The JOAL Project hosts a reference implementation of the Java bindings for
OpenAL API, and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D spatialized audio
for games written in Java. It is part of a suite of open-source technologies
initiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems, with intention of
making the development of high performance games in Java a reality.

This project also hosts the Sound3D Toolkit, a high level API for spatialized
audio built on top of the OpenAL bindings. This toolkit is designed to provide
access to all the features of OpenAL through an intuitive, easy to use,
object-oriented interface.

DescPort: <<
This package requires the OpenAL library. See: http://www.openal.org/

For Java to be able to find the JOAL library, its parent directory needs to be
specified in the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. (Otherwise, you will
get UnsatisfiedLinkErrors when you try to run a program that uses JOAL.) To
set this variable in the bash shell:

  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=%p/lib
