Description: Library for Augmented Reality (AR) tracking
DescDetail: <<
ARToolKit is a software library for building Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. These are applications that involve the overlay of virtual
imagery on the real world. For example, in the image to the right a
three-dimensional virtual character appears standing on a real card. It can be
seen by the user in the head set display they are wearing. When the user moves
the card, the virtual character moves with it and appears attached to the real
object.

One of the key difficulties in developing Augmented Reality applications is
the problem of tracking the users viewpoint. In order to know from what
viewpoint to draw the virtual imagery, the application needs to know where the
user is looking in the real world.

ARToolKit uses computer vision algorithms to solve this problem. The ARToolKit
video tracking libraries calculate the real camera position and orientation
relative to physical markers in real time. This enables the easy development
of a wide range of Augmented Reality applications.
