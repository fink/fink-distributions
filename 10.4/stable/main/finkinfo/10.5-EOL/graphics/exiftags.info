DescDetail: <<
The exiftags utility parses a specified JPEG file or, by default, its standard 
input, looking for a JPEG APP1 section containing Exif (Exchangeable Image 
File) image metadata. The properties contained in these data are then printed 
to the standard output. Digital cameras typically add Exif data to the image 
files they produce, containing information about the camera and digitized 
image.

The program supports a variety of cameras, and includes additional support for 
a portion of the maker notes for Asahi (Pentax), Canon, Casio, Fuji, Leica, 
Minolta, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sanyo cameras. Currently this program 
runs under Windows and Unix-like operating systems.

Two included companion utilities, exifcom and exiftime, perform functions on 
specific tags. exifcom displays and writes the UserComment Exif tag that some 
cameras include in the image metadata they create. This program is useful for 
recording caption or location information in the image file itself.

exiftime displays and adjusts the image's Exif date and time tags. 
Additionally, the utility can list each file in ascending order by date and 
time, suitable for use in further image processing (e.g., production of a Web 
catalog) when filename ordering is not useful.
