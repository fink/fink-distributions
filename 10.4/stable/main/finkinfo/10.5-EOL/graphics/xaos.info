Description: Fractal explorer
DescDetail: << 
XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. It
displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) and
allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal. It uses lots of optimization
techniques to save about 97% of calculations necessary to calculate next
frame to make zooming as fast as possible.

To make result more interesting, various coloring modes, formulas,
planes and palette are supported. XaoS is also able to record and replay
animations using simple script language. We've prepared about half an
hour long movie "Introduction to fractals" with over 500 images and
animations.

For those who are lazy to explore fractals manually an autopilot
function is provided.

DescUsage: <<
  xaos is likely to crash if run remotely (X11 tunnelled over ssh)
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  dmacks upgraded to v3.2, and made the following changes:

  If CFLAGS is not defined, configure crashes during pthreads tests

  Disable assembly because it doesn't compile:
    i386.c: In function '_control87':
    i386.c:31: error: PIC register 'bx' clobbered in 'asm'

  Pass -L for -lggi test (needed to locate -lXext)

  Patch Makefiles to give better diagnostics about where things are
  being compiled and to abort immediately if something goes wrong

  Actually use the gettext flags that configure declares

  Patch sources to use actual locale dir as determined by configure

  Force use system's MAX macro (10.3 vs 10.4 have different
  (re)definition due to #include ordering otherwise)

  Make sure xerror.h gets the #defines it needs

  Avoid duplicate case when certain gii macros are the same

  Remove const declaration from a variable to which we write

  Merge package's own and fink's doc dirs into fink's and symlink 'em
