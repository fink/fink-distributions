Description: Photomosaic generator
DescDetail: <<
Can generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is viewed 
as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which a matching image 
is substitued, as well as collage-style photomosaics, in which rectangular 
parts of the source image at arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a
matrix) are substituted by matching images.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Read readme for instructions. Prepare script has problems on images with
spaces and special characters in the name.
