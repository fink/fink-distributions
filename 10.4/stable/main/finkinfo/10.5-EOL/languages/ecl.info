DescDetail: <<
ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project is an effort to
modernize Giuseppe Attardi's ECL environment to produce an
implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies to the ANSI
X3J13 definition of the language.

The current ECL implementation features:

* A bytecodes compiler and interpreter.
* A translator to C.
* A UFFI-compatible interface to C code.
* A dynamic loader.
* The possibility to build standalone executables and DLLs.
* The Common-Lisp Object System (CLOS).
* Conditions and restarts for handling errors.
* Sockets as ordinary streams.
* The Gnu Multiprecision library for fast bignum operations.
* A simple conservative mark & sweep garbage collector.
* The Boehm-Weiser garbage collector.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris,
Windows, running on top of the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and PowerPC
processors. Porting to other architectures should be rather easy.

DescPackaging:  <<
libecl.dylib is a private library that is only used by executables
within this package.

The package build breaks if there is an installed version, so we 
tag it with BuildConflicts %n until somebody is willing to take it
over and give it some love.
