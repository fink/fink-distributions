DescDetail: <<
Mdate is a utility that converts Gregorian dates to Mayan Long Count
dates. It was originally an implementation of some algorithms
published by N. Dershowitz and E.M. Reingold in their book Calendrical
Calculations , but is now a GPL project and uses some code derived
from other GPL sources.

Mdate is an evolving project, with the desire to provide a
freely-available (meaning non-commercial) mayan date utility for Unix
and other operating systems. To the best of my knowledge, a simple
Unix utility like this has not been available before. At this stage it
has only been tested thoroughly on a Linux system.
