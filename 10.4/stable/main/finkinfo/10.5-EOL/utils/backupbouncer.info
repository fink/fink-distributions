DescDetail: <<
 Backup Bouncer is here to help keep the ugly backup tools
 out of the club. It's a command-line-based test suite that
 makes it easy to find out how bad (or good, if you're lucky)
 your backup software is. It aims to be a comprehensive test
 for preservation of all OS X file metadata.
