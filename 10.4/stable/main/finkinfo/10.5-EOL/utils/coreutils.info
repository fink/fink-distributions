# Patch locale support in gnulib; this prevents a bunch of tests from failing

# Fink will cause test-getlogin to fail as getlogin will report the original
# user that invoked su/sudo. The failure of test-getcwd.sh is residual breakage
# from the fix for "bug#13516: tests/rm/unread3 fails on Mac OS X 10.8".
# Buggy 64-bit posixtime implementation fails posixtm-tests on darwin10.

Description: GNU flavoured basic commands
DescDetail: <<
The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
which are expected to exist on every operating system.

Previously these utilities were offered as three individual sets of
GNU utilities, fileutils, shellutils, and textutils. Those three have
been combined into a single set of utilities called the coreutils.

The commands are named with 'g' prefix like 'gls' or 'gcp'. If you want
to use them as 'ls' or 'cp', add %p/lib/coreutils/bin to your PATH
or install the coreutils-default package.

As the exception, the 'rm' command is named as 'rm.gnu' instead of 'grm'
because the cwp-su package has another 'grm'.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The exotic commands like mknod may or may not work in a useful manner
on Darwin. Following commands are removed due to their breakage:
- su
- users
- who
<<
DescPort: <<
charset.alias is deleted because it is empty on Darwin anyway and
causes unnecessary conflicts between packages.

About the jm_cv_func_svid_putenv=yes, see:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2007-10/msg00514.html

Since the ACL support in 10.5 looks buggy and breaks make check,
I turned off it.  I can't tell whether MacOS or coreutils is wrong.

AKH:  made running the test suite optional.

Disable ACL and jm_cv_func_svid_putenv=yes only on 10.5 and backport   
testsuite rounding fixes as well as typo fix from upstream. jhowarth
Use posix_getgroups in lib/getgroups.c to fix test-getgroups on
darwin12 and later. jhowarth

  Package: coreutils-default
  Description: GNU coreutils, without 'g' prefix
  Depends: coreutils (>= %e:%v-%r)
  Conflicts: fileutils (<< 1:5-1), textutils (<< 1:5-1), shellutils (<< 1:5-1)
  Replaces: fileutils (<< 1:5-1), textutils (<< 1:5-1), shellutils (<< 1:5-1)
  DescDetail: << 
The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
which are expected to exist on every operating system.

This package serves the commands without 'g' prefix like 'ls' or 'cp'.
  <<
  DescPort: <<
Symlinks to md5sum and mktemp are not created, as they are already
contained in essential packages.

Symlink to tsort (topological sort) is not created because it breaks
other packages. The GNU version of tsort doesn't output files that are
part of a cycle, while the BSD tsort that ships with Darwin does.

Symlink to base64 is not created because it conflicts against
the base64 package.
