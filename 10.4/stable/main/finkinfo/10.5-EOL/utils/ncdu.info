Description: NCurses Disk Usage
DescDetail: <<
	A disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface, aimed to be run on a
	remote server where you don't have an entire gaphical setup, but have
	to do with a simple SSH connection. ncdu aims to be fast, simple and
	easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like
	environment with ncurses installed.
