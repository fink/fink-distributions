Description: Just Another Make build tool
DescDetail: <<
Jam is a software build tool that makes building simple things simple
and building complicated things manageable.  Jam is a very good solution
in the following situations:
*  Conventional C/C++ compile-and-link builds.
*  Building from the same sources, according to the same dependencies,
on a variety of platforms.
*  Distributing self-contained build steps onto multiple processors.

The version of jam included with Mac OS X has been heavily modified for
use with Project Builder. This is the standard UNIX distribution.
