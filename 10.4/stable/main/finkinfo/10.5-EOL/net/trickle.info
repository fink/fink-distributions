# Additional Data
Homepage: http://www.monkey.org/~marius/trickle/
DescDetail: <<
 Trickle is a voluntary, cooperative bandwidth shaper.  trickle 
 works entirely in userland and easy to use. 
 Currently, trickle supports the shaping of any SOCK_STREAM 
 connection established via the socket(2) interface. Furthermore, 
 trickle will not work with statically linked executables, nor 
 with setuid(2) executables.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 trickle(1) can be used with or without a daemon. The daemon, 
 trickled(8) can manage several trickle session at a time. 
 You can start trickled(8) manually, i.e. 'trickled -d 10 -u 20' 
 which limit aggregate trickle(1) download bandwidth consumption to 
 10 KB/s and upload consumption to 20 KB/s. You can also 
 start trickled(8) during each startup with 'daemonic enable 
 trickle' as root. Edit /sw/etc/daemons/trickle.xml to pass 
 additional option to trickled  
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 By default trickle(1) will depend on trickled(8), that is why they are not 
 separated. However, if trickled(8) is not started, trickle(1)
 will automatically operate in standalone mode.  
<<
DescPort: <<
 Patch some file for poll() support & Darwin related header file. Libtool
 scripts are also updated to build shared libraries

 dmacks: make sure local -I come before global/installed ones.
