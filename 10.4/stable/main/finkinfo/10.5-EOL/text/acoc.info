Package: acoc
Version: 0.7.1
Revision: 1
Description: Arbitrary command output colourer
DescDetail: <<
acoc is a regular expression based colour formatter for programs that
display output on the command-line. It works as a wrapper around the
target program, executing it and capturing the stdout stream.
Optionally, stderr can be redirected to stdout, so that it, too, can
be manipulated.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Use as a wrapper around another command to color its output.
Example: acoc top -u
Read the acoc and acoc.conf manpages.
<<
DescPort: <<
Makefile's install target only does the binary and conf.

Command-name links are not installed so as not to alter the behavior
of common commands by fiat.

Remove use of /usr/local/etc/acoc.conf.
