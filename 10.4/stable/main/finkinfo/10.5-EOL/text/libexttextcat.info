N-Gram-Based Text Categorization library to guess the language that input text 
is written in. 
Fundamentally an adaption of wiseguys libtextcat extended to be UTF-8 aware.

Language model (.lm) files put into shlibs b/c I think those are needed 
for the library to work.
The createfp program is included in the developer header splitoff for now.
