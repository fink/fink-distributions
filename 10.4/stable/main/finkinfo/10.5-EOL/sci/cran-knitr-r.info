DescDetail: <<
This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation 
in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text) files, 
including Sweave, HTML, Markdown and reStructuredText. 
The patterns of code chunks and inline R expressions can be customized. 
R code is evaluated as if it were copied and pasted in an R terminal 
thanks to the evaluate package (e.g. we do not need to explicitly print() 
plots from ggplot2 or lattice). 
R code can be reformatted by the formatR package so that long lines 
are automatically wrapped, with indent and spaces being added, and comments 
being preserved. A simple caching mechanism is provided to cache results 
from computations for the first time and the computations will be skipped 
the next time. Almost all common graphics devices, including those in base 
R and add-on packages like Cairo, cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are built-in 
with this package and it is straightforward to switch between devices without 
writing any special functions. The width and height as well as alignment of 
plots in the output document can be specified in chunk options (the size of 
plots for graphics devices is still supported as usual). 
Multiple plots can be recorded in a single code chunk, and it is also 
allowed to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or just keep the last plot. 
Warnings, messages and errors are written in the output document by default 
(can be turned off). 
Currently LaTeX, HTML, Markdown and reST are supported, and other output 
formats can be supported by hook functions. The large collection of hooks 
in this package makes it possible for the user to control almost everything 
in the R code input and output. Hooks can be used either to format the 
output or to run a specified R code fragment before or after a code chunk. 
The language in code chunks is not restricted to R only (there is simple 
support to Python and Awk, etc). Many features are borrowed from or 
inspired by Sweave, cacheSweave, pgfSweave, brew and decumar.
