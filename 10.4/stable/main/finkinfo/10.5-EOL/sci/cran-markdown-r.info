DescDetail: <<
R Markdown is a format that enables easy authoring of reproducible 
web reports from R. It combines the core syntax of Markdown 
(an easy-to-write plain text format for web content) with embedded 
R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in 
the final document.

The concept of R Markdown is similar to Sweave (a system built-in 
to R for combining R with LaTeX). In Sweave, Rnw files are "weaved" 
into TeX files that are then compiled into PDFs. In R Markdown, 
Rmd files are similarly "weaved" into plain markdown (.md) files 
that are then compiled into HTML documents.
