DescPort: <<
  No darwin flagsets in md.h, so we pick the closest (__unix__) and
  add other flags as compiler errors arise.

  Lots of very differences in test results, but they appear to be
  "very small number" vs zero or two different "very small numbers"
  that should both probably be zero.

  'make install' handles DocFiles; but easier to move them all than
  to than to hack several Makefile paths.

  Really do need to rebuild docs from .tex as they are out-of-date

Description: GNU Circuit Analysis Package
DescDetail: <<
Gnucap is a general purpose circuit simulator. It performs nonlinear
dc and transient analyses, fourier analysis, and ac analysis. It can
also be run in batch mode or as a server. Spice compatible models for
the MOSFET (level 1-7), BJT, and diode are included in this release.
