Description: I/O routines to read/write nifti-1 datasets
DescDetail: <<
Niftilib is a set of i/o libraries for reading and writing files in the
nifti-1 data format. nifti-1 is a binary file format for storing medical image
data, e.g. magnetic resonance image (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) brain
images.

Niftilib currently has C, Java, MATLAB, and Python libraries; we plan to add
some MATLAB/mex interfaces to the C library in the not too distant future.

Niftilib has been developed by members of the NIFTI DFWG and volunteers in the
neuroimaging community and serves as a reference implementation of the nifti-1
file format. In addition to being a reference implementation, we hope it is
also a useful i/o library. Niftilib code is released into the public domain,
developers are encouraged to incorporate niftilib code into their
applications, and, to contribute changes and enhancements to niftilib. Please
contact us if you would like to contribute additonal functionality to the i/o
library.
