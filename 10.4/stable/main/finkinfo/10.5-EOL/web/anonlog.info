# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
Anonlog anonymizes the following items from the original logfile:
filenames (but preserves the extension), visitors' hostnames, referrers,
usernames and virtual hostnames. (Some of these items, especially the
last two, may not be present in every logfile.)

The following items are left unchanged: date and time of each request,
HTTP status code, file size, processing time and browser name.

Search arguments on files and referrers are deleted, and replaced with
an indication that they were present.

Anonlog can read logfiles in several different commonly-used formats.
The anonymized logfile is written to a new file.

The translation uses real words where possible. Furthermore, items are
translated "hierarchically" - for example, if maths.cam.ac.uk became
lemon.bee.to.de then statslab.cam.ac.uk might become greatest.bee.to.de.
(It is configurable whether the new names should be the same length as
the old ones).

The key to the translation can be written to a file if you want. Note
that running the program on the same file twice will not produce the
same results. (This is a deliberate security feature.)

If you run analog on the original and the anonymized logfiles, the
results should be almost exactly analogous (with minor differences due
to different parsing routines) except for analog's Search Word Report
and Search Query Reports, which will be lost, and the Organisation
Report, which will be wrong.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Type 'anonlog' in the terminal and it will print out the anonymized
logfile from the default location (/var/log/httpd/access_log). You can
adjust these settings by editing the config file
/sw/etc/anonlog/anonlog.cfg or by passing another config file: anonlog
my_anonlog.cfg To store the results in a file: anonlog > anonymized.log
<<
DescPackaging: <<
anonlog.pl patched to take one command line parameter: the location
of the config file.
Default location of the apache log file patched into the config file.
