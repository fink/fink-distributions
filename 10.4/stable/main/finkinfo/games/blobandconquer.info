DescDetail: <<
Blob Wars episode II: Blob and Conquer is the sequel to Blob Wars:
Metal Blob Solid. 
With the apparent defeat of Galdov and the reclaiming of the Fire, Time, Space
and Reality Crystals the Blobs' battle was only just beginning. Bob had rescued
many Blobs and fought many battles, but now he had an ever bigger task ahead of
him. The Blobs' homeworld is still littered with the alien forces and Bob once
again makes it his task to lead the counter attack. But even without Galdov the
aliens are still extremely well organised...
