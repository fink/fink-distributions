Description: Symbolic-expression evaluation
DescDetail: <<
GNU libmatheval is a library (callable from C and Fortran) to parse
and evaluate symbolic expressions input as text. It supports
expressions in any number of variables of arbitrary names, decimal and
symbolic constants, basic unary and binary operators, and elementary
mathematical functions. In addition to parsing and evaluation,
libmatheval can also compute symbolic derivatives and output
expressions to strings.
