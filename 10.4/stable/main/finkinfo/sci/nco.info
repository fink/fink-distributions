DescDetail: <<
	Each NCO operator (e.g., ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s),
	performs an operation (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming),
	and outputs a processed netCDF file. Although most users of
	netCDF and HDF data are involved in scientific research,
	these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
	are equally useful in fields like finance.
	This version is OPeNDAP/DODS enabled, so it can be given
	URLs to read remote datasets as if they were local
	netCDF files.
<<

DescPort: <<
Get rid of hardcoded malloc.h for C++ stuff.
Patch out an -lnco that of course links to a library in the 
previously installed version of the package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
It's set up to use dylibs, but they, and their includes, have been safely 
buried in a private directory since the compat_version is 0.0.0 .  If one 
wants to build stuff that links to the library, upstream needs to be nagged.
Otherwise the libraries should be treated as private for now.
