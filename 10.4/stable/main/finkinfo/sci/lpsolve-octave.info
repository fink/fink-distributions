Description: Octave-%type_raw[octave] interface to lpsolve
DescPackaging: <<
AKH: 5.2.2.0-4
Change the install locations to match the directory structure expected by our current
octaveN packages.  

Put the octversion in the name of this package so that folks will know what Octave
version they have installed the package for.  We're only supporting Octave >= 3.6.0
because earlier versions publish many more flags (e.g. for whatever BLAS/LAPACK was
used in building Octave).  Rather than have a forest of variants, we'll not deal
with that (for now).  It cuts down on the deps, too.

Does not appear actually to link to liblpsolve.M.N.dylib.  My guess is that it is using
the static liblpsolve*.a .  We'll leave the Depends: lpsolve%type_raw[maj]-shlibs in
case somebody decides to kill that static lib in the future--which should entail a 
revision bump in _this_ package.

Thanks to JF Mertens for the past maintainership of this package.
