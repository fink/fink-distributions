Description: Wrapper to the ANN library for Octave
DescDetail: <<
The Octave-forge ANN package wraps the ANN library, which provides data
structures and functions for computing exact and approximate nearest neighbors
on an arbitrarily high dimensional point set.

# Packages which serve only Octave-3.0.5 or only Octave > 3.0.5 need
# not use the conditional, of course.

DescPackaging: <<
This package:
Rolls its own ANN (1.1.1) library.  There's a newer upstream version (1.1.2), 
but this package wants stuff that doesn't exist in that version.

ann_wrap.cpp seems to need explicit #includes pointing to the ANN headers, so 
we patch those in.

For some reason when this package reads AR from octave_config_info, it gets 
mangled so that the system doesn't want to execute it.  We simply patch
%b/src/ann/src/Makefile just to use "ar -crv" directly.

Common for all octave-forge packages:
We read in postinst and prerm template scripts installed by octaveN and modify
them to use the name of this package because Octave's package manager can't 
cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template.
