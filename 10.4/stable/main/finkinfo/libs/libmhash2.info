Description: Hash Algorithms Library
DescDetail: <<
Libmhash is a library that provides a uniform interface to several hash
algorithms. It supports the basics for message authentication by
following rfc2104 (HMAC). It also includes some key generation
algorithms which are based on hash algorithms.

Mhash is a free (under GNU Lesser GPL) library which provides a uniform
interface to a large number of hash algorithms. These algorithms can be
used to compute checksums, message digests, and other signatures. The
HMAC support implements the basics for message authentication, following
RFC 2104. In the later versions some key generation algorithms, which
use hash algorithms, have been added. The manpage for mhash is
mhash.3.html. At the time of writing this, the library supports the
algorithms: SHA1, SHA160, SHA192, SHA224, SHA384, SHA512, HAVAL128,
HAVAL160, HAVAL192, HAVAL224, HAVAL256, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD256,
RIPEMD320, MD4, MD5, TIGER, TIGER128, TIGER160, ALDER32, CRC32,
CRC32b, WHIRLPOOL, GOST, SNEFRU128, SNEFRU256

DescPackaging: <<
	Seems to be silent API/ABI break between 0.8.x and 0.9.x, so
	push 0.9.x lib into subdir to create different install_name
