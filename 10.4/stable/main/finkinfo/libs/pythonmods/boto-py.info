The goal of boto is to support the full breadth and depth of Amazon Web 
Services. In addition, boto provides support for other public services such 
as Google Storage in addition to private cloud systems like Eucalyptus, 
OpenStack and Open Nebula.

Boto is developed mainly using Python 2.6.6 and Python 2.7.1 on Mac OSX and 
Ubuntu Maverick. It is known to work on other Linux distributions and on 
Windows. Boto requires no additional libraries or packages other than those 
that are distributed with Python. Efforts are made to keep boto compatible 
with Python 2.5.x but no guarantees are made.
