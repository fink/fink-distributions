Description: SysV poll(2) Emulation Library

The libpoll package provides System V <sys/poll.h> compatibility for
BSD-like OSes.

libpoll is no longer necessary for Panther, this package is
a placeholder to make old packages happy.

DescPackaging: <<
Had to redefine a few things to build but it worked just fine.
