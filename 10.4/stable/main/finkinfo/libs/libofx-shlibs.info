DescDetail: <<
This is the LibOFX library.  It is a API designed to allow applications to 
very easily support
OFX command responses, usually provided by financial institutions.  
See http://www.ofx.net/ofx/default.asp for details and specification. This 
project was first 
started as my end of degree project, with the objective to add OFX support to 
GnuCash 
http://www.gnucash.org/ If you can read French, the original project 
presentation is included 
in the doc directory.  I finally decided to make it into a generic library, 
so all OpenSource 
financial software can benefit.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The package is provided for the benefit of any existing installed package
which depends on libofx-shlibs.  New packages should use libofx1 instead.

This package requires GCC 3.3 to compile.

 This version is compiled with g++-3.3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
