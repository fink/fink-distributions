Version: 1.4.2
Revision: 1001
Distribution: 10.4

Maintainer: Kurt Schwehr <goatbar@users.sourceforge.net>
DescDetail: <<
GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats. As a library,
it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all
supported formats.

Current translators include GeoTIFF (read/write), Erdas Imagine (read),
ESRI .BIL (read/write), .aux labelled raw (read/write), DTED (read),
SDTS DEM (read), CEOS (read), JPEG (read/write), PNG (read/write),
Geosoft GXF (read), Arc/Info Binary Grid (read), FITS (read/write),
netCDF (limited read/write), and GIF (read/write).

The current version of GDAL come with the related OGR library (which lives 
within the GDAL source tree) provides a similar capability for simple features 
vector data.

The OGR Simple Features Library is a C++ open source library (and commandline 
tools) providing read (and sometimes write) access to a variety of vector file 
formats including ESRI Shapefiles, S-57, SDTS, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, and 
Mapinfo mid/mif and TAB formats.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Packages that need GDAL/OGR libraries should builddepend on gdal-dev and 
depend on gdal-shlibs.  Make sure that configure finds the gdal-config 
script in %p/bin, which tells that the headers are 
in %p/include/gdal1/ and the libraries are in %p/lib/.

DescPackaging: <<
Patch file does the following:
  1. add LICENSE.
  2. install header files in %p/include/gdal1.
  3. change the order of include directories not to read header files of 
     older GDAL package.

Previous versions of this package were maintained by Matt Stephenson
<cattrap@users.sourceforge.net>, Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>
and BABA Yoshihiko <babayoshihiko@mac.com>.

DescPort: <<
1.3 conflicts with the gdal headers of older versions. gdal.patch
solves this problem by changing the include orders. For future
versions, gdal13 headers will be in %p/include/gdal13 and so on. (This
has not happened.  Still include/gdal1.  -kurt 12/2006)

1.3 adds HDF-5 support.

1.2.6-5 fixes gdal-config and adds Xerces and SQLite supports.
1.2.6-4 for Python support (see gdal-python-py23)
--with-geos is enabled since 1.2.6-1.

The large number of gdal include files are moved into %p/include
subdirectory and gdal-config has been patched to have the correct
include file path.

Uses -Os, otherwise it compiles with no optimization.

Uses --with-local=%p in ConfigureParams to have -I%p/include and
-L%p/lib be used in compiling this package.  But even with this set,
not all files are compiled with -I%p/include and so this is put in
SetCFLAGS and SetCXXFLAGS.

Uses --with-static-proj4=%p in ConfigureParams, but libproj still ends
up linking dynamically.

Uses --with-hdf4=no in ConfigureParams to avoid a compile error in
EHapi.c.

Franks Warmerdam says using the "internal" settings should not be
necessary, as the libs are tested to see if they are compatible.

As of 1.3.2, removing the Conflict with itself since that -dev was
only able to be installed at the same time as gdal{,-shlibs}

TODO:

There are lots of other formats/libs that could be enabled, but have
not yet been tried.
