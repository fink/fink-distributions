Description: JavaBeans Activation Framework
DescDetail: <<
==============================================================================
With the JavaBeans Activation Framework standard extension, developers who
use Java technology can take advantage of standard services to determine the
type of an arbitrary piece of data, encapsulate access to it, discover the
operations available on it, and to instantiate the appropriate bean to
perform said operation(s).  For example, if a browser obtained a JPEG image,
this framework would enable the browser to identify that stream of data as a
JPEG image, and from that type, the browser could locate and instantiate an
object that could manipulate, or view that image.
