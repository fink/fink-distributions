# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
"Module::Build" is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules.  It is meant to be a replacement for "ExtUtils::MakeMaker".
Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in
a much more straightforward way than with "MakeMaker".  It also does
not require a "make" on your system - most of the "Module::Build" code
is pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way.  In fact, you
don't even need a shell, so even platforms like MacOS (traditional)
can use it fairly easily.  Its only prerequisites are modules that are
included with perl 5.6.0, and it works fine on perl 5.005 if you can
install a few additional modules.

See the "MOTIVATIONS" section in the README for more comparisons
between "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" and "Module::Build".
