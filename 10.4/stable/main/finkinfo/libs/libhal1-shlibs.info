DescPort: <<
	Disable the *-ids because I don't see such a file in OS X.

	Don't have pmu, so disable it.

	Remove --as-needed because it's not available on OS X linker.

	Don't have libvolume_id in fink, so don't bother trying to
	detect it. Detection is omitted on Solaris, so maybe it's not
	mandatory for darwin either?

	darwin isn't known by tools and the default implementations of
	filesystem handling fail because darwin doesn't have getmnt
	and friends, so hack the tools to use the FreeBSD
	implementation.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Don't have user/group "haldaemon" in passwd or know what to
	use instead, so leaving hald as root for now. FIXME!
<<

Description: Hardware Abstraction Layer
DescUsage: <<
WARNING: PolicyKit is disabled. You need to manually edit the hal.conf
         file to lock down the service. Failure to do so allows any
         caller to make hald do work on their behalf which may be
         a huge SECURITY HOLE. I repeat: YOU NEED TO EDIT THE FILE
         hal.conf to match your distro/site to avoid NASTY SECURITY HOLES.

NOTE: You have to install init scripts yourself and tweak your own policy
