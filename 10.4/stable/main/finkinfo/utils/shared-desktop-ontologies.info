DescDetail: <<
The vision of the Social Semantic Desktop defines a user's personal
information environment as a source and end-point of the Semantic Web:
Knowledge workers comprehensively express their information and data
with respect to their own conceptualizations.  Semantic Web languages
and protocols are used to formalize these conceptualizations and for
coordinating local and global information access.  The Resource
Description Framework RDF serves as a common data representation
format.  We identified several additional requirements for high-level
knowledge representation on the social semantic desktop.  With a
particular focus on addressing certain limitations of RDF, we
engineered a novel representational language akin to RDF and the Web
Ontology Language OWL, plus a number of other high-level ontologies.
Together, they provide a means to build the semantic bridges necessary
for data exchange and application integration on distributed social
semantic desktops.  Although initially designed to fulfill
requirements for the NEPOMUK project, these ontologies are useful for
the semantic web community in general.
