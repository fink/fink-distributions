Description: Replacement for OS X "open" command
DescDetail: <<
launch is a replacement for "open" which:
* Opens URLs, directly or in your preferred helper application.
* Lets you specify applications by their four-char creator (e.g. 'ToyS') or 
Java-style
 bundle ID (e.g. com.apple.scripteditor), both of which allow you to move or 
rename an app.
* Asks applications to print documents, something the OS X Finder is missing.
* Launches applications in the background, or launches Carbon applications in 
Classic.
* Shows info about any item on disk, including its file type, creator, data 
and resource fork sizes, dates and bundle ID.

DescPackaging: <<
macosx/dpkg dependency should be added when that code is working.
