Description: Text-based front-end to Remind
DescDetail: <<
Designed to make you more efficient at editing
your reminder files directly. It also offers a
nice day view suitable for visualizing your
schedule at a glance.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Some of the popular OS X terminal emulators have
default configurations that don't properly support
colored curses applications such as Wyrd. A solution
is to set the terminal emulation mode to 'xterm-color'.
Open Terminal application Preferences, and in:
"Declare teminal type ($TERM) as:"
select "xterm-color".

If you use iTerm, open Preferences ->Profiles ->Terminal
->Type and select "xterm-color".
