DescDetail: <<
This is a program I wrote after needing to use the same eventing mechanism in
Mac OS X 10.4 used by Spotlight. It is functionally an exact clone of fslogger
by Amit Singh. I wrote it in response to his utility when I realized that his
source was not free and Apple provided no documentation on this exciting
feature. gfslogger is mostly just a demonstration of how to subscribe to
events, it performs no other function than displaying the events as they
happen.
