Package: logrotate
Version: 3.7.1
Revision: 1
Description: Rotates, compresses, removes and mails logs
License: GPL
DescDetail: <<
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files. Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files. Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size. Normally,
 logrotate would be run as a daily cron job.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Most of the log file rotation in Darwin / Mac OS X is already handled
 by /etc/weekly etc. but /Library/Logs, ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter
 and httpd logs are not.

 See the included examples to create new configuration files and setup CRON.

 Known problems:

 There appears to be a bug in Darwin's implementation of the glob(3)
 routine, even as of Mac OS X 10.2.6 (Darwin 6.6):

 error: error accessing /Users/Shared/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/: No such
  file or directory
 error: Users:16 glob failed for /Users/*/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/*.log

 glibc2 in a similar situation would not return an error.

 The only workaround for the present time is to make sure wildcard
 expressions in logrotate.conf always have a positive match, by
 creating any missing directories:

 mkdir -p /Users/Shared/Library/Logs/CrashReporter

 It is still not clear whether the problem really is in glob, however
 anyone with technical insight into this problem should contact the
 maintainer of this package and consider filing a bug report with
 Apple at <http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/>.

DescPort: <<
 install some basic Darwin / OS X scripts in %p/etc/logrotate.d/
 Changed paths in cron and man files appropriate to Darwin and Fink.
 Added Darwin paths in config.h.
 Patched to include <sys/types.h> for u_int32_t typedef.

 Original maintainer: Carsten Klapp <carstenklapp@users.sourceforge.net>

 1. dmacks (3.7.1-1) make sure normal compiler flag vars are always used.
 2. dmacks (3.7.1-1) cleaned up flag-propagation a bit.
 3. 'PREFIX' is used instead of 'prefix' so InstallScript is needed to build
    the deb file properly (another silly problem for which a fix eluded me
    far far too long DOH).
 4. Install examples and test dirs into docs dir.
 5. dmacks (3.7.1-1) converted to use upstream platform token.
