Description: Common shell commands like ls, touch, chmod
DescDetail: <<
The GNU fileutils package contains common shell commands that work on
files and directories. This includes stuff like ls, mkdir, cp, rm,
chmod and touch. The GNU versions of these utilities often have extra
features like colored directory listings and heaps of command line
options.
<<
DescPort: <<
There are problems with rm (and recursive mv) which may have their
origin in the Darwin kernel. Since this breaks 'rm -rf', rm is
disabled by renaming it to rm.gnu. This appears to be fixed in 10.1,
but the fix persists while we still support 10.0.x.

The exotic commands like mknod may or may not work in a useful manner
on Darwin.

charset.alias is deleted because it is empty on Darwin anyway and
causes unnecessary conflicts between packages.
