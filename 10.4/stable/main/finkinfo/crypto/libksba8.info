Description: Gnupg certificate management library
DescDetail: <<
Libksba is a library to make the tasks of working with X.509
certificates, CMS data and related objects more easy. It provides a
highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents the data
in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry about all the
nasty details of the protocols. The API gives the C programmer an easy
way of interacting with the data. It copes with the version details
X.509 protocols tend to have as well as with the many different
versions and dialects. Applications must usually cope with all of this
and it has to be coded over and over again. Libksba hides this by
providing just one API which does the Right Thing. Support for new
features will be added as needed.
