DescDetail: <<
 PCCTS, the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set, is a set of public-domain 
software tools
 designed to facilitate the construction of compilers and other translation 
systems.
 Although originally developed primarily for internal use within Purdue 
University,
 these tools are now everywhere. While working on his MS and PhD under Prof. 
Hank Dietz, T. Parr
 was the primary developer of PCCTS, and he has continued to maintain and 
extend it;
 see http://www.ANTLR.org/ for info on Ter's work on the latest Java versions.
