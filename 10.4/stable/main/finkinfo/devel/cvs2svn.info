# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
cvs2svn is a Python script that converts a CVS repository to a Subversion 
repository. It is designed for one-time conversions, not for repeated 
synchronizations between CVS and Subversion.

DescUsage: <<
Type 'cvs2svn --help' or 'man cvs2svn' for help. Read the home page for more 
information - also available from 
/sw/share/doc/cvs2svn/www/cvs2svn.html

Check your new repository carefully after conversion. Mail 
dev@cvs2svn.tigris.org if you encounter any problems. You can also ask
questions on IRC at irc.freenode.net, channel #cvs2svn.                        

You may use the tool 'verify-cvs2svn' to verify your conversion. But a
WARNING: The 'verify-cvs2svn' is not yet finished. It may produce false 
warnings or ignore serious problems. Don't trust it!
