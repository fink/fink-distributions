Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
DescDetail: <<
Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from files 
called `Makefile.am'.

The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance from the 
back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back of the Automake 
maintainer).

The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions (with 
rules being thrown in occasionally). The generated `Makefile.in's are 
compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.

Automake 1.5 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake 1.4 did, so 
has been renamed so that the previous version can continue to be made 
available.

Desc from debian :-)

Sets CDPATH in several places, which results in disrupting output from zsh. Removed through a patch.
