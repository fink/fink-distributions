Description: Demo program to experiment with OpenGL lighting
DescDetail: <<
Lightlab is a hybrid GTK/OpenGL program for experimenting with the
OpenGL lighting model. This program lets you set the colors and
positions of three GTK light sources, and watch the effect that has on
a simple 3D scene. You can select whether the scene contains a
rotating cube, sphere, or teapot, and whether that object has a
texture image on its surface.
