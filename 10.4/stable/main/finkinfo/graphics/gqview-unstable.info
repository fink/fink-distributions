Description: Browser for graphics files
DescDetail: <<
GQview is a browser for graphics files
offering single click viewing of your graphics files
includes thumbnail view, zoom and filtering features
and external editor support.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This is a dummy package that might help remind you to switch to
the real "gqview" if you used to use "gqview-unstable". The switch
is not completely automatic. If you get an error about conflicts
that prevent installing gqview because gqview-unstable is installed,
simply remove gqview-unstable and then install gqview and you will
be all set.
