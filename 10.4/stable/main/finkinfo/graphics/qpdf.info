#---- Documentation ------------------------------------------------------

DescDetail: <<
From http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/:

QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving
transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something like
pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of
PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards
of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.

QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as web-optimized) files
and encrypted files. It is also capable of converting PDF files with
object streams (also known as compressed objects) to files with no
compressed objects or to generate object streams from files that don't
have them (or even those that already do). QPDF also supports a special
mode designed to allow you to edit the content of PDF files in a text
editor. For more details, please see the documentation links below.

QPDF is not a PDF content creation library, a PDF viewer, or a program
capable of converting PDF into other formats. In particular, QPDF knows
nothing about the semantics of PDF content streams. If you are looking for
something that can do that, you should look elsewhere. However, once you
have a valid PDF file, QPDF can be used to transform that file in ways
perhaps your original PDF creation can't handle. For example, programs
generate simple PDF files but can't password-protect them, web-optimize
them, or perform other transformations of that type.
