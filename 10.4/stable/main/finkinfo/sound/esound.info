Description: Enlightened Sound Daemon
DescDetail: <<
EsounD, the Enlightened Sound Daemon, is a server process that mixes
several audio streams for playback by a single audio device. For
example, if you're listening to music on a CD and you receive a
sound-related event from ICQ, the two applications won't have to
jockey for the use of your sound card.     
<<
DescPort: <<
This package uses a patch by Shawn Hsiao and Masanori Sekino to enable
playback and recording via the CoreAudio API. It uses some evil hacking
to keep the CoreAudio dependency out of the library - there were
symbol clashes between CarbonCore (one of CoreAudio's dependencies)
and several esd-using programs.

Also needs some help to link against the right copy of its own library.

Applied a iMacs/eMacs patch from Alexander Strange (>= 0.2.28).

Detects ARTS, but then doesn't use it (?) so no need for dependencies.

Do not link util.o into esd executable because that object is already
present as libesd_la-util.o in libesd.dylib, which is also linked into
esd. See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317554

Employs a patch from Ojas Parekh for CoreAudio device selection.

<<
DescUsage: <<
Users have reported that esd can suddenly stop producing sound due to
changes to the OS X MIDI output bit-rate, and that 44100 Hz works.
