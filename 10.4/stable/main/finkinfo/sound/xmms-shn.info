Description: XMMS plugin to play shorten (shn) files
DescDetail: <<
It's an XMMS input plugin to play shorten (.shn) files.  As of version
2.0, xmms-shn no longer depends on an external shorten executable to
function.  However, to take advantage of the real-time seeking
capabilities built into version 2.x, you have to seek-enable your
.shn's with the new version 3 of shorten.
