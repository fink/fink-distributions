Description: Musical MIDI Accompaniment
DescDetail: <<
"Musical MIDI Accompaniment" is an accompaniment generator -- it
creates midi tracks for a soloist to perform over from a user supplied
file containing chords and MMA directives.

MMA is very versatile and generates excellent tracks. It comes with an
extensive user-extendable library with a variety of patterns for
various popular rhythms, detailed user manuals, and several demo
songs.

MMA is a command line driven program. It creates MIDI files which are
then played by a sequencer or MIDI file play program.

MMA is currently in BETA. We are looking for lots of help in debugging
the program, creating songs for distribution, and new and improved
library files.

There are lots of other generators like MMA. The most popular are
"Band In A Box" and "Jammer". The problem with many of these programs
is that they lock you into a proprietary format, work only with
limited computing platforms, or insist on a silly GUI which limits
your choices. You might think that the lack of a GUI is limiting, but
we've found that MMA's method gives you a great deal of flexibilty in
setting volumes, patterns, etc.
