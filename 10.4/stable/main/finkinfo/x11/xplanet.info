DescDetail: <<
Xplanet is similar to Xearth, where an image of the earth is rendered 
into an X window.  Xplanet can display several different map 
projections, including Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, 
or rectangular, as well as a window with a globe the user can rotate 
interactively.  The other planets and some satellites may also be 
displayed.  The latest version can always be found at 
http://xplanet.sourceforge.net. Versions after 0.95 lack the -animate 
and other commands. If you prefer to install version 0.95, type 
"fink install xplanet-0.95".
<<
DescUsage: <<
A man page is available. Also see %p/share/doc/%n/README. Configuration 
options are documented in %p/share/doc/%n/README.config. Those using 
xplanet as part of a screensaver and/or upgrading from a previous 
version of xplanet should read the NEWS file. Many critical things have 
changed, including settings for use with xscreensaver.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Builds with support for x11, openGL and aqua (see 
http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/OSX/). Added support for x screensaver 
module.

Have to disable quicktime on OS X to avoid libstdc++ linking mess.

dmacks fixed -I ordering. See:

DescPort: <<
signbit() hack stolen from FreeBSD. It's in libSystem and appears to
be in cmath, not sure why compiler can't find its prototype.
