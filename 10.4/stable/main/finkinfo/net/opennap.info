DescDetail: <<
When doing the Install, OpenNap seems to be missing 
a directory called opennap which contains user config 
files for the app. This should be installed into /sw/share 
but is not during the installation process. There may be 
a way in the program to set this up, butyou can simply created 
it manually. All the files are derivative of some 
sample.xxx files which come with the uncompiled 
version in the root directory. One must rewrite those 
files according to the OpenNap manual -- apparently 
not with the instructions in the files themselves, which 
is outdated. Then remove "sample." from the file name 
and place the files in the /sw/share/opennap directory. 

Note: for OpenNap to work, at least the config and user files must be
completed properly, with the user file containing at least 
one Elite user. 

Please see the manual.html included with the uncompiled package
for full instructions.
