# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Powerful network protocol analyzer
DescDetail: <<
Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows.
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture
file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing
summary and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the
ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Might eventually link against and depend on geoip and libsmi.
Since the former is not in stable and the latter is not maintained,
I am not (yet) doing this.

The Makefile.in patch causes wiresharek-filters.o to be compiled with
-Os, thus avoiding clang bug http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12228.
