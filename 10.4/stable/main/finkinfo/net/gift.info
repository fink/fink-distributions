Description: Metapackage for the giFT filesharing system
DescDetail: <<
giFT is a modular daemon capable of abstracting the communication
between the end user and specific filesharing protocols (peer-to-peer
or otherwise). The giFT project differs from many other similar
projects in that it is a distribution of a standalone
platform-independent daemon, a library for client/frontend
development, and modules for their own homegrown network, OpenFT, as
well as the existing Gnutella network.

This metapackage depends on the daemon and plugins available from the
giFT project itself, and ensures you have a client package installed.
