Description: Command-line gnutella client
DescDetail: <<
 Mutella is a command-line gnutella client that supports such things as
version 0.4 and 0.6 protocols, real multiple search support (~100 searches
work fine), passive search (all query-reply packets are checked against
local search list), automatic re-submission of the queries, automatic
search for alternative locations when download fails to start immediately
and auto-get function for broken downloads.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Type 'mutella' at the command prompt to start the client. For a list of
commands just type 'help'. Type 'help <command>' for more specific info on
a particular command.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Originally packaged by Matt Stephenson.

 This version is compiled with g++-3, even in the 10.4 tree.  If it is
 ever updated to a more recent compiler, any packages which depend on
 this one must be updated at the same time.
