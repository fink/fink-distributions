Description: Fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language
DescDetail: <<
Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice
features such as input completion and history and a powerful locals
facility, and it even has (the beginnings of) a manual. Gforth employs
traditional implementation techniques: its inner interpreter is
indirect or direct threaded.
<<
DescPort: <<
The makefiles just ignore the CPPFLAGS, I resorted to pass them in CC.
Had to add a dummy emacs directory because the makefile checks its existence.
