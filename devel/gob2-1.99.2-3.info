Description: Preprocessor for building GTK+ Object (Version 2)
DescDetail: <<
GTK Object Builder 2 (GOB2) is a simple preprocessor for easily creating GTK
objects. It reads a class description file with inline C code and produces
.c and .h object files for you. It allows you to easily use all of the
features of the GTK object system and avoids typos by reducing the amount
of code needed. In general, the amount of code is about the same as for
OO languages such as Java or C++, but you still have to only use C and
you get all the power of the GTK object system.
