    The Cyrus::IMAP module provides an interface to the Cyrus imclient
    library.  These are primarily useful for implementing cyradm operations
    within a Perl script; there are easier ways to implement general client
    operations, although they may be more limited in terms of authentication
    options when talking to a Cyrus imapd.
    .
    The modules that compose Cyrus::SIEVE are also included, but they are
    undocumented upstream.
