Description: IPC library used by some GnuPG related software 
DescDetail: <<
Libassuan is a small library implementing the so-called Assuan
protocol. This protocol is used for IPC between most newer GnuPG
components. Both, server and client side functions are provided.

Assuan was developed for use by the GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, to
prevent potentially buggy clients from unwittingly corrupting
sensitive transactions or compromising data such as a secret key.
Assuan permits the servers, which do the actual work, e.g. encryption
and decryption of data using a secret key, to be developed
independently of the user interfaces, e.g. mail clients and other
encryption front ends. Like a shared library, the interface is well
defined and any number of front ends can use it; however, unlike a
shared library, the client cannot see or touch the server's data. As
with any modular system, Assuan helps keep the servers small and
understandable help to make code more understandable and less error
prone.
