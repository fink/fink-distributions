Monotone has changed its database format.
If you're upgrading from version 0.16 or previous, you'll need to migrate to
the new format.  The instructions to do that are here:
http://www.venge.net/monotone/UPGRADE
Step 1-3 of the migration REQUIRES the old version of monotone.
If you have not already performed steps 1-3 of the migration procedure,
hit ctrl-C NOW and do so.  Otherwise, hit enter to continue.\n\n"

Description: Distributed version control system
DescDetail: <<
Monotone is a free distributed version control system. It provides a simple,
single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected operation and
an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization protocol. It understands 
history-sensitive merging, lightweight branches, integrated code review and
3rd party testing. It uses cryptographic version naming and client-side RSA
certificates. It has good internationalization support, has no external
dependencies, runs on linux, solaris, OSX, and windows, and is licensed under
the GNU GPL.
