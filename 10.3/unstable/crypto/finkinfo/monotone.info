Description: Distributed version control system
DescDetail: <<
Monotone is a free distributed version control system. It provides a simple,
single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected operation and
an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization protocol. It understands 
history-sensitive merging, lightweight branches, integrated code review and
3rd party testing. It uses cryptographic version naming and client-side RSA
certificates. It has good internationalization support, has no external
dependencies, runs on linux, solaris, OSX, and windows, and is licensed under
the GNU GPL.
