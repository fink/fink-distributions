DescPort: <<
Doesn't use autoconf. Comes with a big selection of Makefiles
instead. We use the included Makefile for Darwin, which builds dynamic
libraries (the OS X Makefile only builds static libraries).  This
Makefile was written by Christoph Pfisterer for the Fink project and 
accepted by the upstream maintainers of libpng.

Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.

This package is named libpng3 because in version 1.2.1 the major version
number was set to 3.  The major version number was changed again in 1.2.2, 
and the library renamed to libpng12, but this was intended as a backward-
compatible change to 1.2.1.  Since the upstream makefiles include symlinks 
for backward compatibility, we have not changed the name of the Fink package,
which was established as libpng3 at version 1.2.1.
