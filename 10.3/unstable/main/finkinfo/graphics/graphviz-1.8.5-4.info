Description: Graph visualization software
DescDetail: graphviz is a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows 
  (win32), including a web service interface (webdot). Graph drawing 
  addresses the problem of visualizing structural information by 
  constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and 
  networks. Automatic generation of graph drawings has important 
  applications in key technologies such as database design, software 
  engineering, VLSI and network design and visual interfaces in other 
  domains.
