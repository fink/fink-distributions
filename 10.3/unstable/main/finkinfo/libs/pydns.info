PyDNS (dnslib) is a phyton module that implements a DNS
(Domain Name Server) client, plus additional modules that define some
symbolic constants used by DNS (dnstype, dnsclass, dnsopcode).

Type "python dnslib.py -/" for a usage message.

You can also import dnslib and write your own, more sophisticated
client code; use the test program as an example (there is currently no
documentation :-).
