Description: CD Input and Control Library *BINARIES*
DescDetail: <<
  The Compact Disc Input and Control library encapsulates CD-ROM reading
  and control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
  device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM can use this library. Some support
  for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available, so applications
  that use this library also have the ability to read disc images as though
  they were CDs. A sample utility for displaying CD info is included, as is
  a library for working with ISO-9660 filesystems.
