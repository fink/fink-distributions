Description: TeX-based WYSIWYG editor
DescDetail: <<
 GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
 by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured
 documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user
 friendly interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program
 implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which
 help you to produce professionally looking documents.

 The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
 generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for
 computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme
 extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write
 your own extensions to the editor.
<<
DescPort:<<
 TeXmacs uses wget for getting online help files; the package depends
 therefore on wget. 
 
 For font-intensive documents, the default OS X stacksize of 512 kB
 is insufficient (segmentation fault!), so we set it to 8 MB.
 
 This version does some static linking stuff that doesn't work
 on darwin, so we don't build STATIC_TEXMACS any more.

 Uses guile-1.6 now. Apparently we need to
 set the PATH for guile-1.6 only at compile time. The runtime is OK,
 even though guile-1.4 may be installed and `which guile` points to it.
<<
DescUsage:<<
 Provides a unified GUI for macaulay2, maxima, octave, pari-gp, scilab 
 if they are installed. No configuration necessary, they are auto-detected 
 at program startup.
 
 Ghostscript is needed for importing images. Since even the TeXmacs 
 documentation contains images, ghostscript is strongly recommended. 
 
 For importing non-postscript images, the netpbm package is recommended.
 
 If you want to avoid having to create the standard bitmap fonts
 on the fly, consider installing the texmacs-fonts package.
