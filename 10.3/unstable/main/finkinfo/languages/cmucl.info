DescDetail: <<
CMUCL (Carnegie-Mellon Common Lisp) is a free, high performance
implementation of the Common Lisp programming language.  It mainly
conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS; the Common Lisp Object System;
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp.
<<

DescUsage: <<
The Darwin/PPC port of CMUCL is fairly very new and this fink package
builds from a CVS snapshot of the source code, not an official
release.  Expect to encounter bugs, missing features and other
difficulties.

Type ``lisp'' at a shell prompt to start CMU CL.
<<

DescPackaging: << 
Building CMU CL from source is a little complicated.  I use Pierre Mai's
build scripts to do the heavy lifting.  The bootstrap binary may have to
be patched with some of the items in src/bootfiles/19a/ for the build to
succeed.  Some experimentation may be necessary.  Concat all the required
bootfiles into a file called ``bootstrap.lisp'' and place it in the src
directory.  Currently, we are using a binary of the latest snapshot to
bootstrap building a binary of the latest snapshot, which seems like kind
of a waste of time, but is in keeping with fink's packaging policies.  It
does have the added benefit that, at least in theory, it should not be
necessary to patch the bootstrap binary. 

Patches are to keep make-dist.sh and related scripts from actually
creating a tarball or removing their staging directory (``./release'')
which is used by fink's install phase.

This package should not be moved to fink's stable tree until the next
full official upstream release at the earliest.  For the time being,
it tracks CMU CL's monthly CVS snapshots.
