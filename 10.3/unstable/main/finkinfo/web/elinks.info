DescDetail: <<
Development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser), with more
liberal features policy and development style.

This is the ELinks tree - intended to provide a feature-rich version
of Links. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to Links, and to
test and tune various new features, but still provide good rock-solid
releases inside stable branches.

DescPort: <<
Add missing paramater to assertm() in src/document/html/table.c.

Don't know why src/formhist/Makefile includes 2 copies of formhist.o
in libformhist.a, but leaveing it alone for now.

configure and src/Makefile.am lump -liconv in with other libs causing
compiling to crash when -liconv is used as a dependency. Deconvolute
these in configure and src/Makefile.in so we don't have to re-autoconf
or mess with m4.

po/Makefile ignores prefix= passed with 'make install' but respects
DESTDIR= so do it that way.

Remove stray non-package-specific config.charset and charset.alias.

Solved bus error during table layout: assertm() doesn't optimize
boolean expressions ("a && b" seems to evaluate b even if a is false)
so mustn't compare pointer values until we know they point at
something.

Fink has lua5 but elinks is written against lua4 so diable lua support.

Docs say guile isn't finished being implemented so disable it.

Not going to require X11. For info about why it is needed at all, see
