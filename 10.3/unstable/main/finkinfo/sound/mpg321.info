Description: Mpeg audio player for layer 1, 2, and 3
DescDetail: <<
 mpg321 is a free replacement for mpg123, a very popular command-line mp3
player. mpg123 is used for frontends, as an mp3 player and as an mp3 to
wave file decoder (primarily for use with CD-recording software.) In all 
of these capacities, mpg321 can be used as a drop-in replacement for
mpg123.
