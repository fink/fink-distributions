+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm Jing
+accepts the following command-line options, which must precede the
+arguments specifying the schema and files to be validated:
+.Bl -tag -width Fl
+.It Fl c
+The
+.Ar schema
+uses RELAX NG Compact Syntax.
+.It Fl e Ar enc
+Uses the encoding
+.Ar enc
+to read the
+.Ar schema .
+.It Fl f
+Checks that the document is feasibly valid.  A document is feasibly
+valid if it could be transformed into a valid document by inserting
+any number of attributes and child elements anywhere in the tree.
+This is equivalent to transforming the
+.Ar schema
+by wrapping every data, list, element and attribute element in an
+optional element and then validating against the transformed
+.Ar schema .
+This option may be useful while a document is still under
+construction.  This option also disables checking that for every IDREF
+there is a corresponding ID.
+.It Fl i
+Disables checking of ID/IDREF/IDREFS. By default,
+.Nm
+enforces the constraints imposed by RELAX NG DTD Compatibility with
+respect to ID/IDREF/IDREFS.
+.It Fl t
+Prints the time used by
+.Nm
+for loading the
+.Ar schema
+and for validation.
