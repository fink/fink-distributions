Description: Layout program
DescDetail: <<
Scribus is a Layout program for Linux., similar to Adobe PageMaker[tm], 
QuarkXPress[tm] or Adobe InDesign[tm], except that it is published under 
the GNU GPL. 

Currently, it is still in its early stages of development, but rapidly
maturing and very useable. Already, it has the ability to layout
newsletters, create corporate stationery, small posters and other
documents which need flexible layout and/or the ability to output to
professional quality imagesetting equipment. You can do all the
typical tasks like placing and rotating text and/or images on a page,
specify manual kerning of type and much more.

While the goals of the program are for ease of use and simple easy to
understand tools, Scribus offers support for professional publishing
features, such as CMYK color, easy PDF creation, Encapsulated
Postscript import/export and creation of color separations.

Graphic formats which can be placed include Ecapsulated Post Script
(eps), Joint Photographic Experts Group (jpeg), Portable Network
Graphics (png) and XPixMap(xpm)

DescUsage: <<
 The online help files are not included in this version.
 To get them, install the scribus-i18n-en package.

 Fonts: By default, the X11 Type1 fonts are recognized. If you
 want more fonts, you can do one or more of the following:
 - Install the x-ghostscript-fonts or msttcorefonts or xfonts-intl
   packages (also the applesystemfont package once it becomes available
   for OSX 10.3. The gimp-sharefonts and similar packages work, too,
   but these fonts are of rather bad quality)
 - Put lines like
     /Library/Fonts
     /System/Library/Fonts
   into your ~/.scribus/scribusfont.rc file (create it if it doesn't exist)
   This will give you many (not all) of the Apple system fonts.
   If you use FontBook to create your own collections, put also
     ~/Library/Fonts
   into this file.
  Not all font types are working: OpenType and Resource Fork TrueType
  don't work, but the latter can be converted using fondu.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The Makefile needs some help for the final linking.
 Plugin compiling overrides some libtool logic, but this is simpler
 than to import the whole KDE admin directory packet.
 The declaration of error disagreed with the one of dlerror in dlfcn.h 
 from dlcompat.
 The Little CMS library lcms is now required.
 This version has a patch for the Bus Error problem when LANG is set.
 Evil hack to link to Fink's libfreetype2.6.dylib. Hopefully only temporary.
