Description: Tool which allows the replaying of captured net traffic
DescDetail: <<
tcpreplay is a BSD-style licensed tool to replay saved tcpdump files at arbitrary speeds.
It provides a variety of features for replaying traffic for both passive sniffer devices 
as well as inline devices such as routers, firewalls, and the new class of inline IDS's.

This program was written in the hopes that a more precise testing methodology might be 
applied to the area of network intrusion detection, which is still a black art at best.

Many NIDSs fare poorly when looking for attacks on heavily-loaded networks. 
tcpreplay allows you to recreate real network traffic from a real network 
for use in testing.

tcpreplay includes the following tools:

* tcpreplay - the tool for replaying capture files
* tcpprep - a capture file pre-processor for creating cache files for tcpreplay
* capinfo - the tool for printing statistics about capture files
* pcapmerge - a tool for merging pcap files into one larger one (1.4.x only)
* flowreplay - a tool for replaying connections (1.5.x only)
