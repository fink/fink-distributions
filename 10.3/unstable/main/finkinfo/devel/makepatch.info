Description: Perl scripts to make and apply patches
DescDetail: <<
The makepatch package contains two programs, both written in Perl:
'makepatch' and 'applypatch'.

'makepatch' will generate a patch kit from two source trees. 
It traverses the source directory and runs a 'diff' on each pair of
corresponding files, accumulating the output into a patch kit. It
knows about the conventions for patch kits: if a file named
patchlevel.h exists, it is handled first, so 'patch' can check the
version of the source tree. Also, to deal with the non-perfect
versions of 'patch' that are in use, it supplies 'Index:' and
'Prereq:' lines, so 'patch' can correctly locate the files to patch,
and it relocates the patch to the current directory to avoid problems
with creating new files.
