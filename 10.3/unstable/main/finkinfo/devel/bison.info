Description: Parser generator
DescDetail: <<
Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
description for an LALR context-free grammar into a C program to parse
that grammar. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to
develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple
desk calculators to complex programming languages.

locale.alias is deleted because it is already provided by gettext which
is an essential package, hence we can relay on the file to be always present.
