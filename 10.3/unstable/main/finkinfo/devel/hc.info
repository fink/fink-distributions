Description: The Hacker's Calculator
DescDetail: <<
From Brian Connors (the author) :
	"So one day in 1998 I picked up my (currently missing) copy of Kernighan and Pike (The Unix Programming Environment, for those of you who don't know one white computer book with an AT&T copyright from another) with the thought that there didn't seem to be a whole lot of calculator programs out there that specialized in hacker-type calculations, i.e. things like hex and octal bases and bitwise operations. So I took the book's hoc code and hacked it up here and there, stripped out unnecessary features, and hc was born."
