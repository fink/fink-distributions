Description: Java based build tool
DescDetail: <<
Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell based commands, it is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell commands, the configuration files are XML based calling out a target tree where various tasks get executed. Each task is run by an object which implements a particular Task interface.

Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec rm {}` but it gives you the ability to be cross platform. To work anywhere and everywhere. And hey, if you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an exec rule that allows different commands to be executed based on the OS that it is executing on.

DescPackaging: <<
 I copy all the files to lib because there need to be a ANT_HOME env var.
 Linked the binaries in ... bin :-)
 Linked the docs to share/doc/%n
<<
DescPort: <<
 the chmod task of ant would fail with 
    Java: UNIXProcess:forkAndExec: exec failed: Argument list too long
  because apprently it tries to chmod thousands of files in a single line of command,
  another solution is to set parallel to false, which cause chmod to process one file after
  the other but then we get a java.io.IOException: Too many open files. Conclusion
  use unix chmod in InstallScript ;-)
 Removed *.bat in bin
