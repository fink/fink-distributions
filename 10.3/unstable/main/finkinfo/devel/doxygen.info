Description: Documentation system for C++, Java, IDL and C
DescDetail: <<
  Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, Java, IDL and C
  .
  1.  It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or 
  an off-line reference manual (in  ) from a set of documented source 
  files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), 
  PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The 
  documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it 
  much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.
  .
  2. Doxygen can be configured to extract the code structure from 
  undocumented source files. This can be very useful to quickly find 
  your way in large source distributions. The relations between the 
  various elements are be visualized by means of include dependency 
  graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are 
  all generated automatically.
  .
  3. You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation (as 
  I did for this manual).
