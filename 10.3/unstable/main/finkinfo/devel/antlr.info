DescDetail: <<
ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a language
tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
Java, C#, or C++ actions. ANTLR provides excellent support for tree
construction, tree walking, and translation.
