Description: Processing and Displaying Swath Sonar Data
DescDetail: <<
MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and
display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from
multibeam, interferometry, and sidescan sonars. This software is
distributed freely (and for free) in the form of source code for Unix
platforms. The heart of the system is an input/output library called
MBIO which allows programs to work transparently with any of a number
of supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has allowed the
creation of "generic" utilities which can be applied in a uniform
manner to sonar data from a variety of sources. Most of the programs
are command-line tools, but the package does include graphical tools
for editing swath bathymetry, editing navigation, modeling bathymetry
calculation, and adjusting survey navigation.

Has its own internal proj library that will not be installed so that
it will not conflic with the standard proj.
