Description: Environment for statistical computing
DescDetail: <<
R is similar to S, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John
Chambers et al. It provides a wide variety of statistical and
graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical
tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, ...).  R is
designed as a true computer language with control-flow constructions
for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to add additional
functionality by defining new functions. For computationally intensive
tasks, C and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

The "recommended" R packages are now included in the distribution, so
there is no longer a need for a r-recommended package.  If you already
have installed an earlier version of r-recommended, remove it before
installing this package.

Builds R Framework, installs in %p/Library/Frameworks.

R.app no longer included in the R source distribution.  To install, go 
to http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/, download and install R-GUI.dmg.
You will then need to edit Info.plist inside the app bundle to point
to %p/Library/R.Framework (instead of /Library/R.Framework).
<<
DescPort: <<
 R_HOME_DIR variable in wrapper scripts must be re-set to installation
 directory after make install.
 Patch to Makefile.in to add %p to framework path when building extensions.
 Uses FSF gcc from g95 package, since apple's gcc miscompiles R.
