Description: Tools to plot data sets
DescDetail: <<
 GMT is a free, open source collection of ~60 UNIX tools that allow
 users to manipulate (x,y) and (x,y,z) data sets (including filtering,
 trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and produce Encapsulated
 PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots
 through contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D
 perspective views in black and white, gray tone, hachure patterns,
 and 24-bit color. GMT supports 25 common map projections plus linear,
 log, and power scaling, and comes with support data such as
 coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.

 When using the fink install of GMT, make sure not to have GMTHOME set.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Remove xgrid suppl package so x11 not required.

 Tweaks by Kurt Schwehr to jump from 4.0 to 4.1.1.  Trying to not use
 the patch from before.  Also trying to optimize gmt so that things run
 much faster.

 Is no-cpp-precomp still needed?  Maybe just 10.3

 Would probably better to just ranlib *.a
