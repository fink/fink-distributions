Description: Molecular Biology Open Software Suite
DescDetail: <<
EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially
developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user
community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of
formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from the
web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package, it is a
platform to allow other scientists to develop and release software in
true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently
available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless
whole.
<<
DescUsage: <<
See the README file for other environment variables you may need to
configure. See http://emboss.sourceforge.net/Jemboss/ for
information on using the Jemboss GUI for EMBOSS. To prevent conflicts,
the headers are located in /sw/include/EMBOSS instead of /sw/include.

Install emboss-kaptain for a GUI that works with X-Windows.
<<
DescPort: <<
  dmacks added explicit linking to libs that supply symbols used by
  the shared libraries here. This prevents things that link against
  the shared libraries from having to know to pass additional flags
  when the linker requires all symbols be defined.
