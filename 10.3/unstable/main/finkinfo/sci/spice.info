Description: SPICE - circuit simulation
DescDetail: <<
A general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear dc, nonlinear
transient, and linear ac analyses. Circuits may contain resistors,
capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and 
current sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy 
transmission lines (two separate implementations), switches,uniform 
distributed RC lines, and the five mostcommon semiconductor devices: 
diodes, BJTs, JFETs, MESFETs, and MOS FETs.

DescPort: <<
Did very little. No optimization because the compiler seg faults on grid.c, made some mods to grid.c to make it compile at all.
ng-spice on sourceforge might be the way to go, when they have it working :-)
UNIX man pages are installed but according to the docs they are old and may be out of date.
For gcc3, opimization works :-) Test for libtermcap in /usr/lib and add it to the conf if it is there.
