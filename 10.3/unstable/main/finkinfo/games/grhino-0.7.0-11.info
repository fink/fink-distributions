Description: Strong othello game for GNOME
DescDetail: <<
What distinguish GRhino from most other Othello games is that GRhino
will be targeted for experienced Othello players. Strong AI is the main
focus with some additional good, useful features (like an endgame
solver) is planned. The ultimate target strength of the AI is that it
should be able to beat the best human player at the highest difficulty
level. Beating  Logistello (the strongest program available) is not in
the plan :)
