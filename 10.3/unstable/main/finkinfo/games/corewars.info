Description: Assembler simulation game
License: GPL
DescDetail: <<
Corewars is a simulation game where a number of warriors try to crash 
each other while they are running in a virtual computer. 

The warriors can be written in one of two assembler-like languages 
called Corewars and Redcode. Corewars is the default language and is 
easier to learn and understand. Redcode provides more advanced and 
powerful instructions but also requires more time to learn.

DescUsage: <<
Some people reported that the "Load Directory" menu takes more than
one minute before it opens the dialog box. In case you wonder,
corewars does not hang.
