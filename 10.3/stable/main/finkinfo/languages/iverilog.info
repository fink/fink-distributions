Package: iverilog
# Remember to fix Source line as well:
Version: 0.8
# almost the same as 16, but bison in 10.3/stable is currently old enough to
# work (1.35), so I dropped the dependency.
Revision: 17
Depends: readline-shlibs
Provides: verilog

# bison from Xcode 1.5+Nov2004 (ver. 1.2.8) works, but some versions from
# Fink (1.875 and later, but not including 2.0) break the build.
BuildDepends: gperf, readline, libncurses5, bison

Description: Icarus Verilog

DescDetail: <<
Icarus Verilog is a Verilog compiler that generates a variety of
engineering formats, including XNF and EDIF netlists for synthesis,
and waveform files from simulation. It strives to be true to the
IEEE-1364 standard.

A testbench is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtest
<<

DescPort: <<
Instructions from macos.txt were followed, adapting them for the
Fink way of doing things.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
SetCXXFLAGS is used because CPPFLAGS does not appear to be honored (this
problem manifests itself as an inability to find readline/readline.h).
