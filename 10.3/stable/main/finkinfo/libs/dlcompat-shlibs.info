Description: Dynamic loading compatibility library (shared libs only)
DescDetail: <<
dlcompat provides the dlopen() interface for dynamic loading of
modules for applications that need it. It was written by
Jorge Acereda and Peter O'Gorman.

dlcompat is no longer necessary for Panther, this package provides
the shared libs for any ancient packages which still need them
