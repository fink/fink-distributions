Description: Drug dealing game set in New York
DescDetail: <<
  Dopewars is a UNIX rewrite of the MS-DOS program of the same name, which
  in turn was inspired by John E. Dell's "Drug Wars" game. You have one month
  to buy and sell drugs on the streets of New York, the aim being first to
  pay off your debt to the loan shark and then to make a fortune. And if you
  have to shoot a few cops in the process, well... The game includes TCP
  networking allowing you to meet (and shoot) other human drug dealers.
  Computer drug dealers are currently in development.
