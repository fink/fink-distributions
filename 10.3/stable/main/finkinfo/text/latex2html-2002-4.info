Description: Converts LaTeX documents to HTML
DescPort: <<
We substitute /bin/ls for mkteklsr during compile/install to avoid problems
if mktexlsr is not present on the system.  We run mktexlsr (if present) in
a Post Install script instead.

The patch is against the source as of August 2001, updating to the source
as of 7 March 2002.  The source has been revised without being renamed at 
the primary site, so we now download the source from a secondary site, check 
to make sure that the wrong version was not previously cached by the user, 
and then patch.

Thanks to Ross Moore and Daniel Steffen for modifying the upstream code
to enable the DESTDIR method.
