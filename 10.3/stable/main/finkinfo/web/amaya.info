Description:	W3C's Editor/Browser
DescDetail: <<
	Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring 
	environment and comes equipped with a "WYSIWYG style" 
	of interface, similar to that of the most popular commercial 
	browsers. With such an interface, users can easily generate
	HTML and XHTML pages, as well as CSS style sheets, MathML
	expressions, and SVG drawings (full support of SVG is not yet
	available, though).
	Amaya includes a collaborative annotation application based
	on Resource Description Framework (RDF), XLink, and
	XPointer.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Patches the configure script to stop it checking for appkit
	(bad amaya) in both Amaya and libwww (which one person raised
	as a problem). Also fixes bug linking to shared graphics
	libs.
	Patches Makefile.libwww to link statically to the Amaya libwww
	(otherwise build conflict with libwww).
	Patches Options.in to fix precomps problem, find gtk headers,
	and ensure graphics libs linked.
	Slight hack to make Amaya install in /sw/share/Amaya with
	link from /sw/bin/amaya to amaya executable. (Default would
	have /sw/Amaya, which isn't pretty).
	Disables i18n support, enables dav (due to configure error).

	Changes from 6.1
	
	libwww updated. Required updating libwww config.guess.
	Raptor (RDF parser) added - needed minor fix.
	Moved from install in lib to share - seems more sensible.
	CFLAGS (et al) stuff patched in Options.in.
	AHTURLTools.c patched from CVS version - crashed on css
	otherwise.
	gtk is now the default - not using *tif now.

	Changes from 5.3-x:
	
	Patching better - less done. As a result this .info file is a
	little messy, but gtk and lesstif patches are identical now,
	and there are only minor differences in .info files.
