Description: Multi-purpose WAVE data processing and reporting utility 
DescDetail: <<
shntool is a multi-purpose WAVE data processing and reporting
utility. File formats are abstracted from its core, so it can process
any file that contains WAVE data, compressed or not - provided there
exists a format module to handle that particular file type.

shntool has native support for .wav files.  The Fink package causes
flac, shorten (shn), and sox (aiff) to be installed.
