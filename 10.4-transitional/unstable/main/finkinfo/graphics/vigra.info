Description: Computer Vision Library
DescPort: <<
VIGRA stands for "Vision with Generic Algorithms". It's a novel computer
vision library that puts its main emphasize on customizable algorithms
and data structures. By using template techniques similar to those in
the C++  Standard Template Library, you can easily adapt any VIGRA
component to the needs of your application, without thereby giving up
execution speed.

  Shared libraries disabled until they update their libtool.
  If anyone wants to figure out the libtool fix for this one, feel free,
  its a monster - they used an old alpha CXX libtool branch.
