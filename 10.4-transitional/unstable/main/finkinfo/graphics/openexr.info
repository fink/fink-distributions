Description: dynamic-range image file tools
DescDetail: <<
OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format
developed by Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer
imaging applications.

OpenEXR is used by ILM on all motion pictures currently
in production.  The first movies to employ OpenEXR were
Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Men in Black II,
Gangs of New York, and Signs. Since then, OpenEXR has
become ILM's main image file format.

OpenEXR's features include:

* Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing
  8- and 10-bit image file formats.
* Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point,
  and 32-bit integer pixels.  The 16-bit floating-point
  format, called "half", is compatible with the half data
  type in NVIDIA's Cg graphics language and is supported
  natively on their new GeForce FX and Quadro FX 3D
  graphics solutions.
* Multiple lossless image compression algorithms.  Some of
  the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression
  ratios on images with film grain.
* Extensibility.  New compression codecs and image types
  can easily be added by extending the C++ classes
  included in the OpenEXR software distribution.  New
  image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can
  be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting
  backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
  applications.
