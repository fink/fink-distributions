Description: SGML standard (ISO 8879) entity sets for special characters
DescDetail: <<
The SGML standard (ISO 8879) included several sets of entity definitions for 
many special characters:

* ISOlat1 gives the characters in extended Latin alphabet #1, which is also 
the upper part of ISO 8859-1
* ISOlat2 gives a whole lot of extra latin characters
* ISOgrk1 and ISOgrk2 give simple modern Greek characters
* ISOcyr2 and ISOcyr2 give modern Russian and non-Russian Cyrillic characters
* ISOdia gives spacing versions of diacritical marks (and is therefore not 
very useful, I think)
* ISOpub, ISOtech give symbols used in publishing and science
* ISOnum, ISOgrk3 and ISOgrk4 give symbols used in mathematics
* ISObox gives the box characters (yuck)

These entity sets allow you to use special characters in your document, 
regardless of what the document character set you are using. Well known 
examples are "&lt;", "&amp;", or "&mdash;".
