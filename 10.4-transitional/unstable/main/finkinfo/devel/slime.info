DescDetail: <<
SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) extends Emacs with
new support for interactive programming in Common Lisp. The features
are centered around slime-mode, an Emacs minor-mode that compliments
the standard lisp-mode. While lisp-mode supports editing Lisp source
files, slime-mode adds support for interacting with a running Common
Lisp process for compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and so
on.
<<

DescUsage: <<

Make sure Emacs' `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible lisp
implementation by including something like this in your .emacs file:

  (setq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl")

Currently, sbcl, openmcl, cmucl, clisp, lispworks, allegro cl, and abcl
are supported to varying degrees.

Use `M-x slime' in Emacs to start slime and connect to a supported Common Lisp
environment.

Open a lisp-mode file and do `C-h m' to see the mode description.

Security note: SLIME has Lisp open a one-use TCP listen socket for
Emacs to connect to for setting up communication. With all Lisps
except CLISP and ABCL this socket is bound to the loopback interface
and thus inaccessible to remote hosts. Be aware that if an attacker
connected to this server port before Emacs then they could have the
Lisp process execute arbitrary code.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
The ChangeLog needs to be available to SLIME at run time for correct
operation (at least for v1.0; don't know about more recent stuff)
