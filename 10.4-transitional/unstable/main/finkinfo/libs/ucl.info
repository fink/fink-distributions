Description: Real-time data compression library
DescDetail: <<
 UCL is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
 It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression.
 Decompression requires no memory.
 UCL is a data compression library which is suitable for data
 de-/compression in real-time. This means it favours speed
 over compression ratio.

 As compared to LZO, the UCL algorithms achieve a better 
 compression ratio but decompression is a little bit slower.
