+Growl using Apple events instead of the Cocoa API.
 
-It tries various perl modules to accomplish this, in descending order of preference: L<Mac::Glue>*, L<Mac::OSA::Simple>, L<MacPerl> (which defines C<DoAppleScript>), and L<Mac::AppleScript>.  As a last resort, it will use C<osascript(1)>, a command line program that should be available on all Mac OS X machines.
