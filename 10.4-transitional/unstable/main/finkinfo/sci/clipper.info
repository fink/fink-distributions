Description: Object-oriented crystallographic libraries
DescDetail: <<
The aim of the project is to produce a set of object-oriented libraries 
for the organisation of crystallographic data and the performance of
crystallographic computation. The libraries are designed as a framework 
for new crystallographic software, which will allow the full power of 
modern programming techniques to be exploited by the developer. This 
will lead to greater functionality from simpler code which will be easier 
to develop and debug. NOTE:  This is an older CVS version of clipper required
to build COOT.  Should you require clipper to build other programs, please
install the package ccp4lib and ccp4lib-dev as it contains the more current
version of the clipper libraries.  Eventually when coot is made to be
compatable with the newer clipper libraries, this package will be
combined with the newer clipper libraries provided in ccp4.
