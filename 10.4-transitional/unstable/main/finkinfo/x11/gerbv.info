Description: Gerber (RS-274D/RS274X) CAM file viewing tool
DescDetail: <<
Gerber Viewer (gerbv) is a viewer for Gerber files. Gerber files
are generated from PCB CAD systems and are sent to PCB manufacturers as the
basis for the manufacturing process. 

This is the stable branch, using GTK+1. New features and GTK+2 support will
be in another Fink package (gerbv-gtk2).

A new feature as of 0.16 is the inclusion of a scheme interpreter, which
enables support for "project files" to provide default settings
every time the viewer is invoked.
