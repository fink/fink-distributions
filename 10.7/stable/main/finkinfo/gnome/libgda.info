DescPackaging: <<
	Regenerating gtk-doc files The Right Way (--enable-gtk-doc) is
	very slow, so just patch the prefix in the bad URLs in the
	existing generated files.

	Fix installation of trml2* python scripts. Move to to libdir
	and rename to include install_name versioning. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=579458

	Use embedded sqlite3 per upstream recommendation (to get
	function metadata). Fix -I ordering to make sure don't get
	external sqlite3.

	Lots of files (plugins, data, gettext catalogs) are in *4.0
	(less versioned than install_name) dirs. Need to hack those
	dirnames if we get another shlibs package with install_name
	4.0.[^4]. Apparently it's mostly runtime stuff where user at
	least might want 4.0's and 3.0's programs concurrently to
	control both versions' databases. So as of 4.0.2-3, move
	versioned binaries into new major-versioned package
	libgda4.0-bin (which also includes related data files).

	No idea why so much stuff is recompiled during InstallScript.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Try to make sure local libs are linked first: very important
	since there are wrappers in the nascent libgda-sqlite.la that
	need to mask and intercept calls to those in the global
	libsqlite3.dylib. NB: still not fixed, or may be cured now
	that using libtool2 and castrated external .la files.

	Make sure -framework flag is passed safely into .la

	Recent glib doesn't publish -lintl, so pass it directly.

	getsp.class is compiled for a different platform (why doesn't
	Makefile.am have a .java.class: javac recipe or configure.in
	try that as part of its java environment tests?). Our otool -L
	tries to read it and crashes, so just delete the file. Could
	javac manually if we actually needed it for something, but for
	now we are --without-java anyway.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	This is just the basic library and sqlite support. Most
	databases are explicitly disabled to avoid a *huge* package
	that has "N-1" database types that any one user doesn't need.
	Othre database support modules appear to be plugins that could
	be built as stand-alone packages.
