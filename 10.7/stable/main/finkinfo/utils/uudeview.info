Description: Powerful UU decoder
DescDetail: <<
Helps you transmit and receive binary files over the Internet, using
electronic mail or newsgroups The UUDeview package includes both an
encoder and a decoder. The decoder automatically detects the type of
encoding used, offering MIME's Base64 and BinHex as well as the
popular uuencoding and the less frequently used xxencoding
methods. Recently, support for the popular yEnc encoding was also
added. The encoder runs the other way around and encodes a binary file
for sending it by mail or news.
.
To clear up the most common misunderstandings right away, you do not
need UUDeview when downloading files from the World Wide Web, but only
when using E-Mail and/or Usenet newsgroups. UUDeview does not offer
file compression or encryption
