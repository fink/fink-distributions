DescDetail: <<
KDED stands for KDE Daemon which isn't very descriptive. KDED runs in the 
background and performs a number of small tasks. Some of these tasks are 
built in, others are started on demand.
Built in tasks:
* Checking for newly installed software and updating ksycoca when new 
software is detected. Updating of ksycoca is done by the program 
kbuildsycoca which gets started by kded. When kded is first started it 
always runs kbuildsycoca to ensure that ksycoca is up to date.
* Checking for newly installed update files. Applications can install *.upd 
update files. These *.upd files are used to update configuration files of 
users, primarily when new versions of applications are installed with (
slightly) different configuration file formats. Updating of configuration 
files is done by kconf_update. kded starts kconf_update when it detects a 
new update file. When kded is first started it always runs kconf_update to 
ensure that it has not missed any update files. kconf_update keeps track of 
which update files have been processed already in the config-file 
kconf_updaterc. It only performs a certain update once.

Configuration of built in tasks.

The built in tasks have some configuration options that can be changed by 
editing the kdedrc configuration file. Changes need to be made with a text- 
editor, there is no GUI available. All options are listed under the [General] 
group:

HostnamePollInterval: This can be used to adjust the time interval at which 
the hostname is checked for changes. The time is specified in milliseconds 
and has a default of 5000 (5 seconds).

CheckSycoca: This option can be used to disable checking for new software. 
ksycoca will still be built when kded starts up and when applications 
explicitly request a rebuild of the ksycoca database. The user can also 
manually rebuild ksycoca by running the kbuildsycoca program. The default 
value of this option is "true". Checking can be disabled by setting this 
option to "false".

CheckUpdates: This option can be used to disable checking for update files. 
kconf_update will still be run when kded starts up. The default value of this 
option is "true". Checking can be disabled by setting this option to "false".

CheckHostname: This option can be used to disable checking for hostname 
changes. The default value of this option is "true". Checking can be disabled 
by setting this option to "false".

Example kdedrc file with default values:

[General]
HostnamePollInterval=5000
CheckSycoca=true
CheckUpdates=true
CheckHostname=true
CheckFileStamps=true
DelayedCheck=false

If FAM or DNOTIFY is not available, the filesystem will be polled at regular 
interval for any changes. Under the [DirWatch] group in the kdeglobals file 
the following options are available to adjust the polling frequency:

PollInterval: This can be used to adjust the time interval at which the local 
filesystem is checked for new software or update files. The time is specified 
in milliseconds and has a default of 500 (0.5 seconds).

NFSPollInterval: This can be used to adjust the time interval at which remote 
filesystems, such as NFS or Samba, are ebing checked for new software or 
update files. The time is specified in milliseconds and has a default of 5000 
(5 seconds).

The above options are not used when FAM is used to watch for changes in the 
filesystem, or when DNOTIFY is used. Specifying larger intervals may reduce 
the CPU load and/or network traffic. Shorter intervals are not recommended.

Please note that in previous versions of KDE these options where listed in 
the kderc file.

Example kdeglobals fragment:

[DirWatch]
PollInterval=500
NFSPollInterval=5000

KDED modules

Some things can be greatly simplified if they can be coordinated from a 
central place. KDED has support for modules that will be demand-loaded 
whenever an application attempts to make DBus call to the module. This can 
be useful for central administration tasks.
