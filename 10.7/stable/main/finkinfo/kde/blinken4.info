DescDetail: <<
Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges 
players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the 
device, there are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own 
distinctive sound. These buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence 
that the player must then recall. If the player is successful in 
remembering the sequence of lights in the correct order, he advances to 
the next stage, where an identical sequence with one extra step is 
presented. If the player makes a mistake, the game is lost, and the player 
must start again from the beginning. The goal is to get a high score - 
each step in the sequence is worth one point, so correct entry of a 
sequence of 8 lights is worth 8 points on the high score table.
