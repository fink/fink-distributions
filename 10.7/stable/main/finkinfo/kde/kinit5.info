DescDetail: <<
kdeinit is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used for 
booting UNIX.

It launches processes by forking and then loading a dynamic library which 
should contain a 'kdemain(...)' function.

Using kdeinit to launch KDE applications makes starting a typical KDE 
applications 2.5 times faster (100ms instead of 250ms on a P-III 500). It 
reduces memory consumption by approx. 350Kb per application.
How it works

kdeinit is linked against all libraries a standard KDE application needs. 
With this technique starting an application becomes much faster because now 
only the application itself needs to be linked whereas otherwise both the 
application as well as all the libraries it uses need to be linked.
Startup Speed

Starting an application linked against libqt, libkdecore and libkdeui in 
the conventional way takes approx. 150ms on a Pentium III - 500Mhz. Starting 
the same application via kdeinit takes less than 10ms.

(application without KApplication constructor, the KApplication constructor 
requires an extra 100ms in both cases)
Memory Usage

An application linked against libqt, libkdecore and libkdeui started in the 
conventional way requires about 498Kb memory. (average of 10 instances) If 
the same application is started via kdeinit it requires about 142Kb. A 
difference of 356Kb (application without KApplication constructor)

If we take the KApplication constructor into account, an application started 
in the conventional way takes about 679Kb memory while the same application 
started via kdeinit requires about 380Kb. Here the difference is somewhat 
less, 299Kb. This seems to be caused by the fact that the dynamic linker 
does "lazy linking". We can force the linker to link everything at startup 
by specifying "LD\_BIND\_NOW=true". When kdeinit is started with this option 
on, kdeinit is back to its full efficiency, an application with a 
KApplication constructor now uses 338Kb of memory. A difference of 341Kb 
with the normal case.
