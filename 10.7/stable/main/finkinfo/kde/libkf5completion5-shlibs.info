DescDetail: <<
When typing filenames, email addresses and other text where the user often 
wants to select from existing data (including what they previously typed) 
rather than enter anything wholly original, users often find it helpful if 
they only need to type the first few characters, and then have the 
application offer them a set of choices or attempt to finish off what they 
were typing. Email clients, shells and "open file" dialogs often provide 
this functionality.

This framework helps implement this in Qt-based applications. You can use 
one of the completion-ready widgets provided by this framework, or integrate 
it into your application's other widgets directly.
