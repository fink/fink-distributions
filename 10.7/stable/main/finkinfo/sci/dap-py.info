Version: 3.1
Revision: 1
Description: Python Data Access Protocol (dap)
DescDetail: <<
Pydap is an implementation of the Opendap/DODS protocol, written from
scratch. You can use Pydap to access scientific data on the internet
without having to download it; instead, you work with special array
and iterable objects that download data on-the-fly as necessary,
saving bandwidth and time. The module also comes with a
robust-but-lightweight Opendap server, implemented as a WSGI
application.
