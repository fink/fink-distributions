The RDP Classifier is a naive Bayesian classifier which was developed to 
provide rapid taxonomic placement based on rRNA sequence data. The RDP 
Classifier can rapidly and accurately classify bacterial 16s rRNA sequences 
into the new higher-order taxonomy proposed by Bergey's Trust. It provides 
taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for 
each assignment. The RDP Classifier is not limited to using the bacterial 
taxonomy proposed by the Bergey's Manual. It worked equally well when trained 
on the NCBI taxonomy. The RDP Classifier likely can be adapted to additional 
phylogenetically coherent bacterial taxonomies. The new updated RDP Classifier 
now works on Fungal LSU sequences.
