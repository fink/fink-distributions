DescDetail: <<
This package provides a Cairo graphics device that can be use to
create high-quality vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and bitmap output
(PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in displays (X11 and Win32).
Since it uses the same back-end for all output, copying across formats
is WYSIWYG. Files are created without the dependence on X11 or other
external programs. This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent
drawing) and resulting images can contain transparent and semi-transparent
regions. It is ideal for use in server environments (file output) and as
a replacement for other devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities
such as alpha support or anti-aliasing. Backends are modular such that
any subset of backends is supported.
