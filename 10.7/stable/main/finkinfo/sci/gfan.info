Description: Computes Grobner fans and tropical varieties
DescDetail: <<
  Gfan is a software package for computing Grobner fans and tropical varieties,
  which are polyhedral fans associated to polynomial ideals. It contains many
  tools which are useful in the study of Grobner bases, initial ideals, and
  tropical geometry.

  Most of the changes in the patch consist of fixes so that format strings match
  the types of the arguments to printf and friends. In addition, it changes the
  installlinks command to create links with relative instead of absolute paths,
  which would break under fink. Third, it changes the build process to use
  dynamic libraries instead of static ones. Finally, it fixes some of the
  testsuite.
