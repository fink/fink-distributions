DescDetail: <<
LoFreq is a fast and sensitive variant-caller for inferring single-
nucleotide variants (SNVs) from high-throughput sequencing data. It 
is designed to robustly call low-frequency variants by exploiting 
base-call quality values. LoFreq has been used to call rare variants 
in viral and bacterial sequencing datasets and can be used to study 
mitochondrial heteroplasmy and rare somatic mutations in heterogeneous 
tumors.

LoFreq makes full use of base-call qualities (and versions >=0.5 also 
use read mapping qualities) which are usually ignored by other methods 
or only used for filtering. It is very sensitive; most notably, it is 
able to predict variants below the average base-call quality (i.e. 
sequencing error rate). Each SNV call is assigned a p-value which allows 
for rigorous false positive control. Even though it uses no approximations 
or heuristics, it is very efficient due to several runtime optimizations.
LoFreq is generic and fast enough to be applied to high-coverage data and 
large genomes. It takes a minute to analyze Dengue genome sequencing data 
with nearly 4000X coverage, roughly one hour to call SNVs on a 600X 
coverage E.coli genome and 1.5 hours to run on a 100X coverage human exome 
dataset.
