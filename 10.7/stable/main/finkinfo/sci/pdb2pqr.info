DescDetail: <<
PDB2PQR is a Python software package that automates many of the common tasks
of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, providing
a platform-independent utility for converting protein files in PDB format to
PQR format. These tasks include: Adding a limited number of missing heavy
atoms to biomolecular structures Determining side-chain pKas Placing missing
hydrogens Optimizing the protein for favorable hydrogen bonding Assigning
charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields PDB2PQR was
ported to Python by Todd Dolinsky while working with Nathan Baker at
Washington University in St. Louis. The PDB2PQR code is based on C++ design
and algorithms by Jens Erik Nielsen. PDB2PQR was originally designed to
facilitate structure preparation for APBS.  PDB2PQR uses PropKa to determine
protein pKa values. PropKa is developed by the Jensen Research Group at the
University of Iowa. More information about PropKa can be found at
http://propka.chem.uiowa.edu.
