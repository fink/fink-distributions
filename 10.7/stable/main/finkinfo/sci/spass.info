If you are interested in first-order logic theorem proving, the formal
analysis of software, systems, protocols, formal approaches to AI
planning, decision procedures, modal logic theorem proving, SPASS may
offer you the right functionality.

If you are interested in sex, drugs, rock'n roll or fish, even though
our logo contains a nice drawing of Opistognathus Latitabunda, you may
be disappointed by the performance of SPASS.
