DescPackaging: <<
 Based on package created by Morten Kjeldgaard <mok@bioxray.dk> with minor
 edits to conform to standard Fink packaging requirements. Hack of ssm_superpose.h
 in the install script is required to prevent run-time error in coot.

DescDetail: << 
SSM is a macromolecular coordinate superposition library, written by 
Eugene Krissinel of the EBI.

The library implements the SSM algorithm of protein structure
comparison in three dimensions, which includes an original procedure
of matching graphs built on the protein\'s secondary-structure
elements, followed by an iterative three-dimensional alignment of
protein backbone Calpha atoms. 

The algorithm implemented by the software is described in:
E. Krissinel & K. Henrick (2004) Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a
new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.
Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 60, 2256-68.
