Description: Intelligent schema/data migrations for Django

DescDetail: <<
From http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about.html:

South brings migrations to Django applications. Its main objectives are to
provide a simple, stable and database-independent migration layer to prevent
all the hassle schema changes over time bring to your Django applications.

Please note that South is now end of lifed in favour of the new migrations
framework in Django 1.7, which is based on South but with significant design
improvements. South will not work with Django 1.7; it supports only versions
1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.
