Description: JS lib to use Flash's upload functionality
DescDetail: <<
SWFUpload is a JavaScript Library that wraps the Flash Player's upload
function. It brings your uploads to the next level with Multiple File
Selection, Upload Progress and Client-side File Size Checking.
.
Unlike other Flash upload tools, SWFUpload leaves the UI in the developer's
hands. Using a set of event handlers developers can display upload progress
and status to the user in their own HTML/CSS UI.
.
Features:
 * Multiple File Selection
 * File Upload Progress
 * Custom Limits for File Size and Number of Uploads
 * Filter by File Type ie. *.jpg
 * File Queue
 * Customize the Browse Control
 * Flash 10 Support
