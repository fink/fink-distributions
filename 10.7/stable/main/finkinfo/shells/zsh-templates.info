===============================================================================
These files work "out of the box" but you must set this up in one of two ways:

Method 1:  
==========

Make %p/bin/zsh your default user shell.  To do so, you must edit the file 
/etc/shells and add to it the line

 %p/bin/zsh 

Then issue the following command:

 chsh -s /sw/bin/zsh


Method 2:  
==========

Make /bin/zsh your default shell. To do this, issue 

 chsh -s /bin/zsh

Then create the following two symbolic links:

 sudo ln -s %p /share/zsh/templates/etc/zshenv /etc/.
 sudo ln -s %p /share/zsh/templates/etc/zshrc  /etc/.

===============================================================================
===============================================================================

A wiki for zsh-templates has now been created, describing
what is in the package in detail.  It can be visited at the
following URL: http://tinyurl.com/y3r4kp

The command "configure_zsh_templates" will be issued automatically
when an interactive shell is started for the first time. A GUI will
assist the user in fine-tuning the configuration automatically.


===============================================================================

Modifications and enhancements of zsh distributed templates 
were written by Gary Kerbaugh, W. G. Scott, Wataru Kagawa 
and several others. Completion functions _open, _fink, 
_hdiutils, _defaults and their dependencies were written by
Motoi Washida and will be included by default in future versions
of zsh. Some of these (_open, _fink) have been modified to work 
faster.
