Description: Puzzle game based on hexagonal tiles
DescDetail: <<
	Hex-a-hop is a great puzzle game in which a girl has to break all the green
	tiles in an hexagonal map without getting trapped. There is no time limit
	and no real-time element.
	The objective is simply to destroy all the green hexagonal tiles on each of
	the 100 levels. As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are
	introduced which make things more difficult and interesting.
