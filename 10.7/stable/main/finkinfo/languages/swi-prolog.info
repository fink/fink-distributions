Description: SWI Prolog interpreter
DescDetail: <<
SWI-Prolog offers a comprehensive Free Software Prolog environment,
licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License. Together with its graphics
toolkit XPCE, its development started in 1987 and has been driven by the
needs for real-world applications. These days SWI-Prolog is widely used
in research and education as well as for commercial applications.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Packaging is an ersatz for FsHS compliance, and for Shlibs policy
compliance, but hopefully functionally equivalent.
Upstream should be pressed to facilatate FHS compliance,
and if possible before we have to number %n...
(There are already pkgs linking to the dylib, even with the old version _ eg, ppl)

And, once things are correct, probably a %N-lite variant (resurrecting
the former fink pkg with that name IIRC).

X and the tests seem nettlesome.  See:

http://sourceforge.net/p/fink/package-submissions/4344/?limit=10&page=1#ee05

"For the xvfb-run failure, danielj on #fink just discovered that you
have to first run X11 at least once after a reboot for xvfb-run to
work. Both he and I were seeing a similar Xvfb failed to start error,
and just starting X11 once made it work (X11.app doesn't have to be
actually running when the tests run; it just has to have run at least
once)."

<<
DescPort: <<
Without the patch to the link commands, 'essentially' no linking was done:
no undefined symbol had a "from"; with it, all have.
This still has to be communicated upstream.

There do remain errors when running make check; please contribute
fixes _ to the info-file and upstream.
