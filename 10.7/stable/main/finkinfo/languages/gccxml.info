DescDetail: <<
Development tools that work with programming languages benefit from 
their ability to understand the code with which they work at a level
comparable to a compiler. C++ has become a popular and powerful language,
but parsing it is a very challenging problem. This has discouraged the
development of tools meant to work directly with the language.

There is one open-source C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which is
currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The purpose of
the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of a C++ program
from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy to parse, other
development tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the burden
of a complicated C++ parser.
