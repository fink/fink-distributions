Package: box
Version: 0.2.2
Revision: 1
Description: Vector graphics language
DescDetail: <<
    Box is a vector graphics language developed to make graphics as easy as
    possible. Box is in its early stage of development, but it already
    provides most of the features needed to create quality pictures and
    figures. Box has many advantages over traditional GUI graphics editors:

    * Reusability: you can draw things inside a Window; you can then
    translate, rotate, scale and put it inside another Window;

    * Transformation matrices can be calculated automatically from
    constraints given by the user;

    * Flexible syntax: the philosophy is "don't complain if something is
    missing, use default values!". You can specify many parameters, but you
    don't have to!

    * Even more flexible syntax: if p is a list of points then p.Get[3]
    gives the third point, p.Get[3.5] gives a point between the third and
    the fourth and p.Get[(3.5, 1)]... look at the documentation ;-)

    * You can even draw fractal pictures;

    * Box compiles under Linux, Mac and Windows. Packages are available for
    Ubuntu and a zip archive (containing the executable) is available for
    Windows.

    Box has also the following features:

    * Translucency: the alpha channel of colors can be set to draw
    partially transparent objects;

    * Radial and linear color gradients can be set very easily, specifying
    even more than two colors;

    * Supported output formats are Postscript (EPS), PDF, SVG, PNG.

    Patch it to not build ltdl since we use Fink's.
    Clear box_LDFLAGS to link to dylib instead of static.
