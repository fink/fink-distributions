Version: 0.0.0-2013.12.26
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7)

# tied to libversion26; not compatible with gnutls-2.12 on darwin
# because library/__init__.py attempts indirect resolution of
# libgcrypt symbols via libgnutls and libgnutls no longer dyld-links
# gcrypt

DescDetail: <<
A fork of the original python-gnutls project which seems to be dead
(bindings are for GnuTLS version 2.x) which can be found here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gnutls/

Aim of this project is to implement more APIs and upgrade the bindings
to a more recent GnuTLS version.

This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around libgnutls,
as well as low level bindings to the GNUTLS types and functions via ctypes.
The high level wrapper hides the details of accessing the GNUTLS library via
ctypes behind a set of classes that encapsulate GNUTLS sessions, certificates
and credentials and expose them to python applications using a simple API.

The package also includes a Twisted interface that has seamless intergration
with Twisted, providing connectTLS and listenTLS methods on the Twisted
reactor once imported (the methods are automatically attached to the reactor
by simply importing the GNUTLS Twisted interface module).

The high level wrapper is written using the GNUTLS library bindings that are
made available via ctypes. This makes the wrapper very powerful and flexible
as it has direct access to all the GNUTLS internals and is also very easy to
extend without any need to write C code or recompile anything.

DescPackaging: <<
	Does not have formal release yet, so just using git snapshot.

	Hardcodes runtime loading of libgnutls*.26.dylib, so assuming
	it needs that specific ABI. Upstream emailed 2014-03-24 re
	upgrading. Also assumes loading libgnutls* reveals some gcrypt
	symbols, which gnutls-2.12 does not (broken behavior, relying
	on indirect symbol resolution)

	Fix search-path order for runtime loading fink libs
