DescPackaging: <<
	Uses system-python for maximum portability and availability at
	lowest levels of dep trees. And therefore install in private
	libdir to avoid pythonversion dependency.

	Lots of test-fails, but the assertions are often for tuples
	that don't match, except they do; or for things that don't
	seem reproducible at command-line (where it actually matches
	pkg-config behavior when runmanually).

	Upstream fix for runtime adjustment of search-paths. See:
	https://github.com/gbiggs/pykg-config/commit/bf0ac01b845edb1e22ba00256f7e995ef9ea1a5a

	Misc tricks to overcome setup.py mis-handling --with-pc-paths.
	See: https://github.com/gbiggs/pykg-config/issues/10

	Don't check --with-pc-path as if it were a single directory.
	See: https://github.com/gbiggs/pykg-config/issues/12

	And don't crash at runtime if a pc_path entry doesn't exist.

Description: Drop-in pkg-config replacement in python
DescDetail: <<
This is a re-implementation of pkg-config in pure python. As of
version 1.2.0, it is input- and outout-compatible with pkg-config
0.26 (and --version reports as such).

Lists of -I and -L flags are re-sorted to place all fink paths before
any system (/usr or X11) paths; other paths come first, so
PKG_CONFIG_PATH should allow users to over-ride fink, but fink always
over-rides system-supplied paths.
<<
DescUsage: <<
You can run 'pykg-config' directly (it's in fink's default PATH), or,
if you prepend %p/lib/%n/bin to PATH, 'pkg-config' will also run this
python version instead of the real pkg-config program.

pykg-config uses a strict "first match" search scheme to find .pc
files. The default search-path list is hardcoded into the pykg-config
script at compile-time using data from the 'pkgconfig-common' package.
See the pykg-config manpage for env vars that can alter the default.
A dependency on 'pykg-config' (at the version where things work for you)
is the only BuildDepends needed in packages that use others' .pc
files.

Lists of -I and -L flags are re-sorted to place all
fink paths before any system (/usr or X11) paths; other paths come
first, so PKG_CONFIG_PATH should allow users to over-ride fink, but fink
always over-rides system-supplied paths). This operation is controlled
by a wrapper script supplied by the 'pkgconfig-common' package.
