DescUsage: <<
GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
IP address or hostname originates from.  It contains a free GeoIP Country
database that is updated every month.  This database simply contains IP
blocks as keys, and countries as values.  This database should be more
complete and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.  We also offer a paid
database that has greater accuracy than the free version, as well as paid
databases with city level resolution.  For more details see:

DescPackaging: <<
	There's something weird in the generated autotools bits:
	reruns ./configure at start of make and sometimes fails when
	trying to manipulate .deps files. Redoing them
	self-consistently from scatch seems to solve it.
