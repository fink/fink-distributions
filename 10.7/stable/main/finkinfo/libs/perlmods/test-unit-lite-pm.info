Description: Unit testing without external dependencies
DescDetail: <<
This framework provides lighter version of Test::Unit framework. It
implements some of the Test::Unit classes and methods needed to run
test units. The Test::Unit::Lite tries to be compatible with public
API of Test::Unit. It doesn't implement all classes and methods at
100% and only those necessary to run tests are available.
