DescDetail: <<
IO::Socket::INET6 provides an object interface to creating and using sockets
in both AF_INET|AF_INET6 domain. It is built upon the IO::Socket interface and
inherits all the methods defined by IO::Socket.

WARNING: You should use this module mainly to program IPv6
domain. Most pobably future releases will not support AF_INET | AF_UNSPEC
options, as the module seems to fail on some given corner cases. If you require
IPv4, you are encouraged to use IO::Socket::INET from the application
level. Be warned.
