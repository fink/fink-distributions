Description: Automatically apply roles at object creation
DescDetail: <<
Often you want to create components that can be added to a class
arbitrarily. This module makes it easy for the end user to use these
components. Instead of requiring the user to create a named class with
the desired roles applied, or apply roles to the instance one-by-one,
he can just create a new class from yours with with_traits, and then
instantiate that.
