# Additional Info:
DescDetail: <<
These modules provide persistent storage for arbitrary data, in arbitrary
backing stores. The details of interacting with the backing store are
abstracted to make all backing stores behave alike.  The programmer simply
interacts with a tied hash.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Tests disabled since they don't run as nobody and since it would need a
running mysqld if dbd-mysql-pm is installed
