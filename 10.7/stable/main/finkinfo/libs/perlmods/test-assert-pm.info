Description: Assertion methods for those who like JUnit
DescDetail: <<
This class provides a set of assertion methods useful for writing
tests. The API is based on JUnit4 and Test::Unit::Lite and the methods
die on failure.

These assertion methods might be not useful for common
Test::Builder-based (Test::Simple, Test::More, etc.) test units.

The assertion methods can be used in class which is derived from
Test::Assert or used as standard Perl functions after importing them
into user's namespace.

Test::Assert can also wrap standard Test::Simple, Test::More or other
Test::Builder-based tests.

The assertions can be also used for run-time checking.
