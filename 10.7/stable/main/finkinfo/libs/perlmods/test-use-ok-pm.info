DescDetail: <<
According to the Test::More documentation, it is recommended
to run use_ok() inside a BEGIN block, so functions are
exported at compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.

However, people often either forget to add BEGIN, or
mistakenly group use_ok with other tests in a single BEGIN
block, which can create subtle differences in execution
order.

With this module, simply change all use_ok in test scripts to
use ok, and they will be executed at BEGIN time.  The
explicit space after use makes it clear that this is a single
compile-time action.
