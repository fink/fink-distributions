Description: Easy subclassing of non-Moose classes
DescDetail: <<
MooseX::NonMoose allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this,
such as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and
installing (and inlining, at make_immutable time) a constructor that
makes sure things like BUILD methods are called. It tries to be as
non-intrusive as possible - when this module is used, inheriting from
non-Moose classes and inheriting from Moose classes should work
identically, aside from the few caveats mentioned below. One of the
goals of this module is that including it in a Moose::Exporter-based
package used across an entire application should be possible, without
interfering with classes that only inherit from Moose modules, or even
classes that don't inherit from anything at all.
