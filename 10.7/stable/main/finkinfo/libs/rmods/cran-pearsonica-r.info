DescDetail: <<
The Pearson-ICA algorithm is a mutual information-based method for blind
separation of statistically independent source signals. It has been shown
that the minimization of mutual information leads to iterative use of score
functions, i.e. derivatives of log densities. The Pearson system allows
adaptive modeling of score functions. The flexibility of the Pearson system
makes it possible to model a wide range of source distributions including
asymmetric distributions. The algorithm is designed especially for problems
with asymmetric sources but it works for symmetric sources as well.
