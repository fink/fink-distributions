DescDetail: <<
The "care" package implements the regression approach of Zuber and
Strimmer (2011) "High-dimensional regression and variable selection
using CAR scores" SAGMB 10: 34. CAR scores measure the correlation
between the response and the Mahalanobis-decorrelated predictors.
The squared CAR score is a natural measure of variable importance
and provides a canonical ordering of variables. This package
provides functions for estimating CAR scores, for variable
selection using CAR scores, and for estimating corresponding
regression coefficients. Both shrinkage as well as empirical
estimators are available.
