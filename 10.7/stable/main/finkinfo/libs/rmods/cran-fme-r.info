DescDetail: <<
Provides functions to help in fitting models to data, to perform
Monte Carlo, sensitivity and identifiability analysis. It is
intended to work with models be written as a set of differential
equations that are solved either by an integration routine from
package deSolve, or a steady-state solver from package rootSolve.
However, the methods can also be used with other types of functions.
