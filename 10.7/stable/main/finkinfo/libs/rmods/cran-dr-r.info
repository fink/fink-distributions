DescDetail: <<
Functions, methods, and datasets for fitting dimension reduction
regression, using slicing (methods SAVE and SIR), Principal
Hessian Directions (phd, using residuals and the response), and
an iterative IRE. Partial methods, that condition on categorical
predictors are also available. A variety of tests, and stepwise
deletion of predictors, is also included. Also included is code
for computing permutation tests of dimension. Adding additional
methods of estimating dimension is straightforward. With version
3.0.4, the arguments for dr.step have been modified.
