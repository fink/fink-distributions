DescDetail: <<
Aspyct is a Python 2.x and 3.x library including an aspect-oriented 
programming (AOP) engine, Unit Testing tools, and other general-purpose 
components. 
With the help of this library, you can build applications faster, 
and make them test-proof (or even fool-proof).
As of Aspyct 3.0 beta 4, the library is divided in four parts:
- Aspyct.aop, which is the powerful Aspyct AOP engine, and serves 
as central component for other Aspyct features
- Aspyct.unit, a unit testing tool
- Aspyct.utils, a package containing various useful components, 
such as Queryable, Logger, Inject and other
- Aspyct.meta, the only module not relying on the aop engine, 
which contains various metaclasses.
