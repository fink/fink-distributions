Description: Interdependent tasks in a pool of workers
DescDetail: <<
The central instance within async is the Pool. A pool keeps a set of 0
or more workers which can run asynchronoously and process Tasks. Tasks
are added to the pool using the add_task function. Once added, the
caller receives a ChannelReader instance which connects to a
channel. Calling read on the instance will trigger the actual
computation. A ChannelReader can serve as input for another task as
well, which once added to the Pool, indicates a dependency between
these tasks. To obtain one item from task 2, one item needs to be
produced by task 1 beforehand - the pool takes care of the dependency
handling when scheduling items to be processed.

Task instances allow to define the minimum amount of items to be
processed on each request, and the maximum amount of items per
batch. This chunking behaviour allows you to have fine-grained control
about the memory requirements as well as the actually achieved
concurrency for your chain of tasks.
