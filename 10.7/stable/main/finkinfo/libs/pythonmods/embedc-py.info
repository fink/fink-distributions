Type: python (2.6 2.7 3.1)
Description: Python Module for embedding C/C++
DescDetail: <<
	PyEmbedC enables you to write hybrid Python programs that include short
	C/C++ snippets to improve performance. I took my cues from most C/C++
	compilers, which allow you to embed short snippets of Assembly code.

	This is not designed for calling C API's and writing complex C/Python
	hybrid programs. There are already numerous solutions for that. Rather,
	this project enables Python programmers to optimize the speed of their
	programs by coding select sections in C/C++. An important part of the
	design was transparency. Special keywords, "glue" code, etc. are kept
	to an absolute minimum.
