Description: ELF object file access library

DescDetail: <<
'Libelf' lets you read, modify or create ELF files in an
architecture-independent way.  The library takes care of size and endian
issues, e.g. you can process a file for SPARC processors on an Intel-based
system.

This library is a clean-room rewrite of the System V Release 4 library and is
supposed to be source code compatible with it.  It was meant primarily for
porting SVR4 applications to other operating systems but can also be used as
the basis for new applications (and as a light-weight alternative to libbfd).
