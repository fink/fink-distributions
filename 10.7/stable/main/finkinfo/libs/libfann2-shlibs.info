DescPackaging: <<
	nieder:	bumped to 2.2.0 and moved to 10.7
			package used to be named fann/fann-shlibs on 10.4 and used 
			 autotools, but it changed to cmake for 2.2.0 (first version 
			 on 10.7) with c_v downgrading. Renamed to libfann2-{shlibs,dev}
			 in the 10.7 distribution for ease of maintenance.
