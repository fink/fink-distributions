Description: The type class MonadBaseControl
DescDetail: <<
This package defines the type class MonadBaseControl, a subset of
MonadBase into which generic control operations such as catch can be
lifted from IO or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad
transformers in MonadTransControl, which includes all standard monad
transformers in the transformers library except ContT.

See the lifted-base package which uses monad-control to lift IO
operations from the base library (like catch or bracket) into any
monad that is an instance of MonadBase or MonadBaseControl.

Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's monad-peel
library. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style
operators and exploits the RankNTypes and TypeFamilies language
extensions to simplify and speedup most definitions.
