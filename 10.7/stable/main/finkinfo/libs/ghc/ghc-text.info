Description: An efficient packed Unicode text type
DescDetail: <<
An efficient packed, immutable Unicode text type (both strict and
lazy), with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework.

The Text type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and
space-efficient manner. This package provides text processing
capabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both in
terms of large data quantities and high speed.

The Text type provides character-encoding, type-safe case conversion
via whole-string case conversion functions. It also provides a range
of functions for converting Text values to and from ByteStrings, using
several standard encodings.

Efficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported.

These modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name
clashes with Prelude functions, e.g.

 import qualified Data.Text as T

To use an extended and very rich family of functions for working with
Unicode text (including normalization, regular expressions,
non-standard encodings, text breaking, and locales), see the text-icu
