Package: pypdf-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 1.13
Revision: 1
Description: Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit
DescDetail: <<
This module is capable of:

    * extracting document information (title, author, ...),
    * splitting documents page by page,
    * merging documents page by page,
    * cropping pages,
    * merging multiple pages into a single page,
    * encrypting and decrypting PDF files.

By being Pure-Python, it should run on any Python platform without any 
dependencies on external libraries. It can also work entirely on StringIO 
objects rather than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory.
