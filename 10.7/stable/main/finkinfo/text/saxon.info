DescDetail: <<
Saxon 9.6 includes highly-conformant implementations of the latest W3C
Recommendations: XSLT 2.0, XQuery 3.0. XPath 3.0, and XSD 1.1. It also
has an advanced implementation of the latest working draft of XSLT 3.0
(which is nearly completion). See Standards Conformance for more
details.

In addition Saxon continues to offer conformant implementations of
XSLT 2.0. XPath 2.0, XQuery 1.0, and XSD 1.0. When invoking Saxon,
there are options to control which version of the spec should be used:
the default is always to use the latest version that has reached
Recommendation status at the time of the software release.

Saxon 9.6 can also be used to run XSLT 1.0 stylesheets. Although it
does not actually include an XSLT 1.0 processor, XSLT 2.0 with
backwards-compatibility enabled will execute almost any 1.0 stylesheet
with identical results.

This package contains the Home Edition of the Saxon suite.

DescPackaging: <<
SAXON works straight out of the box. The only thing I've added is a
small shell script wrapper to provide a "saxon" shell command and a
copy of the Mozilla Public License v1.0.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Type saxon without any arguments for help (the -? command line switch
is supposed to do this, but seems to get tangled up with tcsh's
filename globbing or something). Full HTML documentation is available
online at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/ .
