Description: Utility to print large-area PDF files
DescDetail: <<
"%n" can be used to create a large poster by building it from
multple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
poster.
The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

This is much like "poster" does for Postscript files, but working
with PDF. Since sometimes poster does not like your files converted
from PDF. :-) Indeed "%n" was inspired by "poster".
<<
DescPackaging: <<
We grabbed a tarball corresponding to the 0.5.0 release from gitorious and put 
it online until the Fink mirror system distributed it.

Set PYTHONPATH in the install phase because the package assumes that it is installed
in a live system.
