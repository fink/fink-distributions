DescDetail: <<
xxdiff is a graphical file and directories comparator and merge tool.
It features:
- Comparing two files, three files, or two directories (shallow and recursive)
- Horizontal diffs highlighting
- Files can be merged interactively and resulting output visualized and saved
- Has features to assist in performing merge reviews/policing
- Can unmerge CVS conflicts in automatically merged file and display them as
  two files, to help resolve conflicts
- Uses external diff program to compute differences: works with GNU diff, SGI
  diff and ClearCase's cleardiff, and any other diff whose output is similar
  to those
- Fully customizable with a resource file
- Look-and-feel similar to Rudy Wortel's/SGI xdiff, it is desktop agnostic
  (i.e. will work equally well with KDE or Gnome)
- Features and output that ease integration with scripts

	Need flex>=2.5.31ish; fink's flex is too old, apple's is
	sufficient (not need flex-devel)

	Need bison<3; need to avoid fink's bison (v3) but apple's is
	sufficient (not need fink's bison-legacy). See
