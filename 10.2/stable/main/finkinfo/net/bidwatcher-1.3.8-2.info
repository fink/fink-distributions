Description: GTK auction management/snipe tool for eBay
DescDetail: <<
* Tracks your eBay listings and items that you have bid on.
* Allows you to track auctions that you do not own and have not bid on.
* Snipe tool allows you to schedule your bid to be placed seconds before 
  the auction ends, avoiding driving the price high early in the auction's life.
* Prioritizes updates according to the time left in an auction.
