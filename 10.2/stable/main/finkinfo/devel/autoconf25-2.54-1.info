Description: System for generating configure scripts
DescDetail: <<
GNU Autoconf is a package for generating configure scripts.
These scripts are present in a large number of free software packages
and are used to detect system features at compilation time.

This package installs the latest Autoconf version. It has some
compatibility problems with older packages. If you want to work on a
package that requires Autoconf 2.13, install the autoconf package
instead.

DescPort: <<
The patch gets rid of code that sets CDPATH. Setting CDPATH causes the
new directory to be printed on a cd, and this breaks some constructs.
