Description: MPEG-[123] tools (encode/decode)
License: GPL
DescDetail: <<
A collection of tools for encoding/decoding/converting mpeg video and 
audio.

The tools in this package enable the preparation of video for 
video cd (VCD) and Super VCD (SVCD).  These formats allow near-VHS 
quality (VCD) and near DVD (SVCD) quality video to be burned onto 
ordinary RW CDs and played back on the majority ofhome DVD players.

The best way to start it to look at the file 
%p/share/doc/%n/mjpeg_howto.txt 
or check out the mjpegtools man page.

DescPort: <<
Version 1.6 port
================
Applied 1.5 patches where not incorporated back in the main source tree

Byteswapping & threading still patched
More stuff builds OK in 1.6

NB Some stuff needs bash so files are patched to find it

Shared libs do build OK - but decided against hassle of putting them in 
the package as there doesn't seem to  be any point (the libs are likely 
to be only used by mjpegtools).

Uses libgnugetopt package - but needed patches to find header - also 
the __GNU_LIBRARY__ flag ensures a full prototype for getopts() is used 
to pamper to the more strict 10.2 compiler.
NB. This lib clashes with the pthread stuff (in 10.1 only?) so need to 
ensure this lib get found before the pthread stuff or get 'bus error'.

Version 1.5 port
================
Added code to support byteswapping - courtesy of binchunker for Unix by
  Heikki Hannikainen <hessu@hes.iki.fi> (http://hes.iki.fi/bchunk/)
lavtools/audiolib.c is not implimented.
Use malloc instead of alloca in yuvmedianfilter.c/yuvscaler.c.  I think too
  many bytes were being alloca'd.  Perhaps a different approach (increase
  stack size?) might be better.
Renamed semaphore_t to mp_semaphore_t to avoid conflicts.  This seemed to
  match changes to the semaphore routines made since the last release.
Threading is disabled by default in mpeg2enc - it hangs.
yuvfilters are not built - make gets an error while building under fink.
