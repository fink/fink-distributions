DescDetail: <<
libquicktime is an enhanced version of quicktime4linux with plug-in 
support for dealing with various audio/video media types.

The tools in the -bin package use the library to read and write 
quicktime files.

Why might I need it?:- Used by mjpegtools to read Quicktime files.

DescPort: <<
Sorted out various flags and stuff to make 'configure' compatible with 
MacOS 10.1 compiler and fink libs + includes.  Also libjpeg/libpng 
tests were not working... but now ok.

Some of the filenames in the tarball are 'case sensitive' in that there 
are two different files whose names differ only in case (RTjpeg.c and 
rtjpeg.c also RTjpeg.h and rtjpeg.h) these have  been renamed, the 
Makefile.in changed and #includes fixed.  Argh!

Oh no. There's a framework called Quicktime - 
#include <quicktime/quicktime.h> picks up the framework include 
- changed all these to "quicktime/quicktime.h" - but is there a better 
way? There are 59!

The plugin loading needs to use dlsym_auto_underscore instead of dlsym.  
For some reason the programs using the library need to run as root 
- suspect it's the plugin loading.

Don't compile utils/lqtplay.c as it uses sys/soundcard.h 
... one day might might fix it.

utils/testqt.c changed to use ceil() (not ceilf())

...why did I choose this as my first! - needs splitoffs - back to the 
manuals again... done!

Lots of fun with libtool!  ltmain.sh (~1.4.?) has various known 
problems patched but had to disable relinking completely - but why 
was it doing it?  Seems fine without it - which is probably what you
would expect.

Patched configure problem causing failure with gcc3 (10.2)
