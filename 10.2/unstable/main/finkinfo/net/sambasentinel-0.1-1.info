Description: Gtk+ frontend to smbstatus
DescDetail: <<
SambaSentinel is basically a gtk-frontend to smbstatus but it extends it
with number of useful features such as: 
* Kill a specific samba-process with a simple mouse-click.
* Multi-threaded (one thread for gui and one for running smbstatus/updating).
* See which files a specific user is accessing.
* Mount and browse a visiting computer (with jags).
