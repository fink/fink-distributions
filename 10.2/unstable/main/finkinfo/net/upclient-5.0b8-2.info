Description: Collects system uptime and displays it at uptimes.wonko.com
DescDetail: <<
 UpClient sends the time a computer has been running since its last
 reboot to the Uptimes Project, and optionally sends cpu usage, idle
 percentage, OS and CPU detail. The server generates individual and
 aggregate statistics of various operating system and hardware
 configurations.

 IMPORTANT: 5.0b8 includes bug fixes to prevent potential buffer
 overflows which could present a local root compromise on BSD-based
 systems (including Mac OS X). All upclient 5 beta users should upgrade
 to 5.0b8 as soon as possible.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 1. Create a user here: <http://uptimes.wonko.com/newuser>
 2. Add a host, this gives you an auth key.
 3. Paste it into /sw/etc/upclient.conf
 4. Run 'daemonic enable upclient' as root, this will install a Startup Item.
 5. To start reporting your uptimes :
    a) either reboot (easy (-:)
    b) or else, if this is a first time installation (or if you know no
       instance of upclient is already running), run :

         sudo /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-upclient/daemonic-upclient start

 Transmission logging to /var/log/system.log is disabled by
 default. To record UpClient transmissions in the system log, add -v
 to /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-upclient/daemonic-upclient as
 follows:

      # run the daemon
      /sw/sbin/upclient -v

 To discontinue upclient, run 'daemonic disable upclient' as
 root. This will not kill a running instance at this time. Reboot the
 machine to get rid of it, or run:

  sudo kill `cat /sw/var/run/upclient.pid`

 To start upclient:

  sudo /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-upclient/daemonic-upclient start
