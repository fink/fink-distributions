Description: Records shoutcast/live365 streams to disk
DescDetail: <<
streamripper records shoutcast compatible and live365 streams. For shoutcast style streams it finds the "meta data" or track separation data, and uses that as a marker for where the track should be separated. For live365 streams it hits the website and finds when a track has changed. Either way, the MP3 data will be decoded and scanned for a silent point which is where tracks will be created.
