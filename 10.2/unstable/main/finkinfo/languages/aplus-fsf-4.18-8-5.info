Description: APL based programming system
DescDetail: <<
 A+ is a powerful and efficient programming language.  It embodies
 a rich set of functions and operators, a modern graphical user
 interface with many widgets and automatic synchronization of
 widgets and variables, asynchronous execution of functions associated
 with variables and events, dynamic loading of user compiled
 subroutines, and many other features. Execution is by a rather
 efficient interpreter.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The XEmacs support works pretty well. You'll need a line like

(autoload 'a "/sw/share/aplus-fsf-4.18/lisp/aplus" 
	"Start an A+ interpreter session" t)
or

(load-file "/sw/share/aplus-fsf-4.18/lisp/.emacs")

in your .xemacs/init.el file. The former approach is recommended
by one who knows better than I citing the loading of A+ support
will slow down font handling for all xemacs files.  Pressing F4
will start an A+ session with the default APL font, load the A+
menus into the menu bar (i.e. load A+ support).
Note that this support is NOT designed for regular emacs.

When using an xterm or Terminal.app window with the A+ fonts be
sure to turn off istrip (stty -istrip).  I've found the font doesn't
work in an xterm with tcsh or bash but does with zsh.  Even with
istrip off tcsh and bash seem to strip the high bit or disable the
modifier keys.  With zsh the modifier is APPLE/CMD and the shift
sense is inverterted even using the supplied XTerm app-default.
!!?!  Feel free to play around with
/sw/share/aplus-fsf-4.18/app-defaults/XTerm and report your results

For setting up a Terminal.app window see the A+ FAQ at
http://aplusdev.org/FAQ/index.html.  The same observations
apply with reagrd to choice of shell.
