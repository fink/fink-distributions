Description: Miscellaneous utilities using DVIlib
DescDetail: <<
This package contains several utilities useful for dealing with TeX DVI files.

dvi2misc generates PostScript, PGM or images for EPSON ESC/Page and Ricoh RPDL
printers from a TeX DVI.  It can be used as an DVI driver for those printers.

dvifontlist displays a list of fonts used in a DVI file, while dvispecials
displays a list of 'special' commands in a DVI file. dvipages shows the number
of pages in a DVI file.

xgdvi, spawx11 and spawg has been separated since they depend on X and/or 
GTK+ libraries. 

This is a part of the TeX-Guy distribution.

Description: A portable DVI interpreter library-dev files
DescDetail: <<
DVIlib2 is a library for handling DeVice Independent(DVI) files which 
are usually generated by TeX.  It can be used for the core engine of your 
DVIware, and thanks to VFlib3 your product will be able to handle 
various fonts.  EPS figures managed by graphicx.sty and Japanese TeX 
DVI files are also supported.

Note that DVIlib2 itself is NOT DVIware.  It's just a library.  If you 
are looking for a complete DVI previewer etc., why don't you try xgdvi or 
spawx11?

Description: a TeX DVI previewer for X, with a nice GTK+ UI
DescDetail: <<
xgdvi is a TeX DVI(DeVice Independent) file previewer for the X Window 
System. xgdvi features a cool GTK+ frontend, and since it uses DVIlib as 
its kernel, xgdvi can handle EPS figures and Japanese DVI files. 
Anti-aliasing is also supported.

spawx11 is a simple TeX DVI(DeVice Independent) file previewer for the X 
Window System.  It has no color support, but anti-aliasing is still 
supported.  No-anti-aliasing versions (spwx11 and spx11) are also 
included, too.
