Description: Graphical musical score editor
DescDetail: <<
Denemo is the GNU graphical musical score editor, and serves as a frontend to Lilypond. 
Though its behavior and features will no doubt continue to be refined, it is already perfectly usable.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	*** The provided keymapping is somewhat different from the one described
	in share/doc/denemo/README because of the way the keyboard is mapped in XDarwin.
	Note also that the keymapping was done on a french keyboard so everything may not work for you.
	You can refer to .denemo/keymaprc in your home directory for more details. ****
<<
DescPort: <<
Mostly changes around malloc.h
NLS disabled due to a bug with keymapping
OS X keymapping provided as default
