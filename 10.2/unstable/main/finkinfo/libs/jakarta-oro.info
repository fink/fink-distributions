Description: Jakarta ORO Regex Library
DescDetail: <<
The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java classes
that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions, AWK-like regular
expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for performing
substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc.  This library is the
successor to the OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools, and TextTools
libraries from ORO, Inc. (www.oroinc.com).  They have been donated to
the Jakarta Project by Daniel Savarese (www.savarese.org), the
copyright holder of the ORO libraries.  Daniel will continue to
participate in their development under the Jakarta Project.
