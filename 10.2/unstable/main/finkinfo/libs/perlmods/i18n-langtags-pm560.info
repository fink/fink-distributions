DescDetail: <<
Language tags are a formalism, described in RFC 3066 (obsoleting 
1766), for declaring what language form (language and possibly
dialect) a given chunk of information is in.
This library provides functions for common tasks involving language
tags (notably the extraction of them, comparing them, and testing the
formal validity of them) as is needed in a variety of protocols and
applications.
I18N::LangTags::List -- tags and names for human languages.  This
module goes from known language tag names ("fr-CA") to their English
names ("Canadian French").  Its documentation also lists the several
hundred known tags and some common subforms.  You may find this useful
as a reference.
