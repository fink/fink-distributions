DescDetail: <<
The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control
system that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open
source community. The software is released under an
Apache/BSD-style open source license.

The goals are:
 - All current CVS features. 
 - Directories, renames, and file meta-data are versioned. 
 - Symbolic links, etc, are supported 
 - Commits are truly atomic. 
 - Branching and tagging are cheap (constant time) operations 
 - Repeated merges are handled gracefully 
 - Support for plug-in client side diff programs 
 - Natively client/server 
 - Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions 
 - Costs are proportional to change size, not project size 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Some tools (e.g. cvs2svn) and examples are stored in 
 %p/share/svn-client/tools
 
 Also look in %p/share/svn-client/notes


 WARNING:
 Subversion is still developing rapidly. Use it at your 
 own risk.

 NOTICE:
 If you have an existing svn repository and are upgrading from 
 a Subversion *earlier* than 0.13.0, it needs to be UPGRADED
 to work with the latest code.  A HOWTO document is included
 in the notes directory of our source tree, and can be read
 online here:

<<
DescPort: <<
This old version needs to stay in cvs for backwards compatibility

The path to the db4 header files had to be included to the
CPPFLAGS: -I/sw/include/db4

Patch needed to stop relinking a .dylib in the install path, 
but hardcoding the /sw/lib path in the link command (i.e. %p) instead 
of using %i (dynamic libraries are not yet enabled in this release.)
