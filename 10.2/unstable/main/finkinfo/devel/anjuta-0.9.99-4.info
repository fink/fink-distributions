Description: Complete Programmers' IDE
DescDetail:	Anjuta is one of the most powerful IDEs available in open
 source today. It supports many different languages, such as C, C++ (both
 with Glade support), Java, Perl, Python, and many more. You can either
 have a single source file with all of your code in it, or you can use
 its built-in wizards to make all kinds of different application 
 projects (such as graphical applications with Glade that can be 
 used with GNOME and KDE).
 Project files store all source files, header files, and libraries together, 
 and everything is compiled as you wish. 
 It also automatically creates files such as NEWS, TODO, README,
 and INSTALL that are typically found in open source applications'
 folders. It also has	a built-in debugging area that uses gdb. The
 standard C compiler it uses is gcc, and the C++ compiler it uses is g++.
 All of these settings can be changed of course, along with a wide range
 of other preferences you can set to truely make the program your own
 development environment.
DescPort: The file "launcher.c" in anjuta-0.9.99-1/src/ has been updated
 to use O_ASYNC for accessing files instead of O_SYNC because O_SYNC
 isn't implimented in Mac OS X.
 DescUsage: After install, simply type 'anjuta' (without the quotes) in
 your X11 environment and Anjuta will launch. To open a file from the
 command line instead of using the program's Open command, simply use
 this syntax: 'anjuta file_name.cpp' (any file type will do, not just
 files with a .cpp ending).
