gretl is an econometrics package. It comprises a shared library,
a command-line client and a gui client that uses GTK.  gretl offers
several least-squares based estimators.  Besides reading data files
in its own format it also reads RATS 4 databases.  It has a built-in
spreadsheet for editing data, and uses gnuplot for graphing.  It can
output regression results in LaTeX format.
