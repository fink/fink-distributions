Description: TINKER molecular modeling software package 
DescDetail: <<
The TINKER molecular modeling software is a complete and general package for molecular 
mechanics and dynamics, with some special features for biopolymers. TINKER has the 
ability to use any of several common parameter sets, such as AMBER94/96, CHARMM27, 
MM2(1991), MM3(2000), OPLS-AA and OPLS-UA. Parameter sets for other standard force 
fields such as UFF, ENCAD, MMFF and MM4 are under consideration. In addition, we are 
actively developing our own TINKER force field based upon polarizable atomic multipole 
electrostatics.

The TINKER package includes a variety of novel algorithms such as a new distance 
geometry metrization method that has greater speed and better sampling than standard 
methods, Elber's reaction path methods, several of our Potential Smoothing and Search 
(PSS) methods for global optimization, an efficient potential surface scanning procedure, 
a flexible implementation of atomic multipole-based electrostatics with explicit dipole 
polarizability, a selection of continuum solvation treatments including several variants 
of the generalized Born (GB/SA) model, an efficient truncated Newton (TNCG) local optimizer, 
surface areas and volumes with derivatives, a simple free energy perturbation facility, 
normal mode analysis, minimization in Cartesian, torsional or rigid body space, velocity 
Verlet stochastic dynamics, an improved spherical energy cutoff method, Particle Mesh Ewald 
summation for partial charges and regular Ewald for polarizable multipoles, a novel reaction 
field treatment of long range electrostatics, and much more.
