Package: gpsdrive
Version: 1.32
Revision: 1
Description: GPS-based navigation tool
DescDetail: <<
GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. GpsDrive
displays your position provided from your NMEA capable GPS receiver on
a zoomable map, the map file is autoselected depending of the position
and prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival"
software is running. The maps are autoselected for best resolution
depending of your position and can be downloaded from Internet. All
Garmin GPS reveiver with a serial output should be usable, also other
GPS receiver which supports NMEA protocol.

For optional MySQL support, install 'mysql-shlibs'.

DescUsage: 'man gpsdrive' to get started.
DescPort: <<
Apple Developer Tools is GNUish, so I don't know why __GNU_LIBRARY__
isn't defined, but it needs to be so that GNU getopt.h (which this
package needs) doesn't conflict with the unistd.h declaration of
getopt().

Hack around ./configure not supporting --docdir (uncontrollably put
under $datadir as share/gpsdrive/gpsdrive).

At run-time, gpsdrive checks if the MySQL client library is available,
and enables MySql support if so. The places and extensions it checks
are hard-coded into gpsdrive.c (and not ./configure-able), but
patching in the Fink paths doesn' seem to work (dlopen() finds the
.dylib, but then dlsym() cannot find the needed symbols). So we disable
MySQL support (for now).
