Description: Scriptable, parallelized ping-like utility
DescDetail: <<
fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar to ping,
but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts. fping has a very long
history: Roland Schemers did publish a first version of it in 1992 and it has
established itself since then as a standard tool for network diagnostics and
statistics.
