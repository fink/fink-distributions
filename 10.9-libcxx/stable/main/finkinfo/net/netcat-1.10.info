Description: TCP/IP swiss army knife
DescDetail: <<
A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network
connections using TCP or UDP protocol.  It is designed to be a reliable
"back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other
programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich network
debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
connection you would need and has several interesting built-in
capabilities.
<<
DescPort: <<
The include file <sys/select.h> requires that <sys/types.h> is
included first on Mac OS X 10.1. Fixed by changing the order. We also
patch a 'darwin' target into the Makefile which is basically a clone
of the 'next' target and add -lresolv for missing symbols (res_init).
Move location of helpme() function declaration to avoid implicit declaration.
