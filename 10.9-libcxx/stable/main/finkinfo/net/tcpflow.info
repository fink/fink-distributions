DescDetail: <<
tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for
protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a summary of
packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's actually
being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams
and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis. 

tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct data
streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery. However,
it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows containing IP fragments
will not be recorded properly.
