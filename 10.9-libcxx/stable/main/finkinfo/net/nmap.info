Description: Network exploration utility
DescDetail: <<
	nmap, a utility for network exploration or auditing, supporting
	ping scanning, port scanning and TCP/IP fingerprinting. It also
	offers decoy scanning, sunRPC scanning, reverse-identd scanning
	and others.

	This package also contains:
		nping: Network packet generation tool / ping utility
		ncat:  Concatenate and redirect sockets
		ndiff: Utility to compare the results of Nmap scans

	In separate packages (of each's name):
		zenmap: GUI

	nmap-update has been abolished upstream. We therefore no longer
	have that separate package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Use fink's libpcre and libpcap instead of building our own.

	Requires exactly lua version 5.4, which fink happens to have.

	Use included libdnet as it is preferred by the package.

	Fink doesn't have liblinear at this time, so hard-code to use
	included for sanity in case fink gets it in the future.

	Previously maintained by Jeremy Higgs <fink@higgs-family.net>

	Version 3.46 thanks to Alex Barclay <prozac@utulsa.edu>
