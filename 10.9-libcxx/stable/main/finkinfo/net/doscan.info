Description: Fast network scanner
DescDetail: <<
	doscan is a tool to discover TCP services on your network. It is designed for 
	scanning a single port on a large network. doscan contacts many hosts in 
	parallel, using standard TCP sockets provided by the operating system. It is
	possible to send strings to remote hosts, and collect the banners they return.

	There are better tools for scanning many ports on a small set of hosts, for 
	example nmap.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Original homepage and download site are down, so use Debian information for 
	the former and Fink mirrors for the latter.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Explicitly include <stdlib.h> for build on 10.9.  Doesn't hurt elsewhere.
