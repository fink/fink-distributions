Description: Enhanced Programmable ircII Client
DescDetail: <<
The ircII/EPIC program is a unix-based character oriented user agent
('client') to Internet Relay Chat.  It is a fully functional ircII client
with many useful extensions.  This version works with all modern irc
server classes as of early 1999.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	--with-localdir handler is a mess. There is no way to disable
	use of *some* dir, either autodetected or hardcoded, and the
	result is used in multiple places later in script. Use fink's
	to avoid something worse getting used instead.

	#Uses the system's Ruby. Headers are buried, so we don't need
	#to BuildConflicts:ruby*-dev because fink-specific
	#version-specific -I are not published by /usr/bin/ruby.

	Use fink's ruby to allow unified package on all fink dists.
	Apple changed versions (including install_name) as of 10.13
	and did not even leave previous available for legacy support.

	Currently does not build Perl bindings because it wants to
	build multi-arch, and failed when I (AKH) tried to force it to
	build single-arch. Therefore disable it (deterministic in case
	somehow detection succeeds). Would require varianting or using
	fink's perl in order to get consistent perl-version.

	Use debian's patch for openssl110:
	https://sources.debian.org/src/epic5/2.0.1-1/debian/patches/openssl-1.1.patch
