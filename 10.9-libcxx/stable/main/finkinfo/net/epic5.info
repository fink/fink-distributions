Description: Enhanced Programmable ircII Client
DescDetail: <<
The ircII/EPIC program is a unix-based character oriented user agent
('client') to Internet Relay Chat.  It is a fully functional ircII client
with many useful extensions.  This version works with all modern irc
server classes as of early 1999.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Patch to use various libiconv*() rather than iconv*()
	functions which aren't in Fink's libiconv.

	The-idirafter flag in CFLAGS is to work around a conflict
	between the local term.h and the ncurses term.h.

	Import upstream fixes for passing interp paths via --with-*

	--with-localdir handler is a mess. There is no way to disable
	use of *some* dir, either autodetected or hardcoded, and the
	result is used in multiple places later in script. Use fink's
	to avoid something worse getting used instead.

	Uses the system's Ruby. Headers are buried, so we don't need
	to BuildConflicts:ruby*-dev because fink-specific
	version-specific -I are not published by /usr/bin/ruby.

	Currently does not build Perl bindings because it wants to
	build multi-arch, and failed when I (AKH) tried to force it to
	build single-arch. Therefore disable it (deterministic in case
	somehow detection succeeds). Would require varianting or using
	fink's perl in order to get consistent perl-version.
