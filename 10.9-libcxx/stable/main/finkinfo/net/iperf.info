Description: Measure TCP and UDP throughput
DescDetail: <<
Iperf is a tool to measure maximum TCP bandwidth, allowing the tuning of
various parameters and UDP characteristics. Iperf reports bandwidth, delay
jitter, datagram loss. 

While tools to measure network performance, such as ttcp, exist, most are very
old and have confusing options. Iperf was developed as a modern alternative
for measuring TCP and UDP bandwidth performance.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The jperf GUI client for iperf is not installed.  This is intentional --
it's old and crufty, so I opted not to install it.  jperf is being split off
of Iperf in future versions and will be it's own package.
