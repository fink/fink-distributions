Description: AMQP task/queue manager

DescDetail: <<
Celery is a task queue/job queue based on distributed message
passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling
as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one or
more worker servers. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the
background) or synchronously (wait until ready).

Celery is already used in production to process millions of tasks a
day.

Celery was originally created for use with Django, but is now usable
from any Python project. It can also operate with other languages via
webhooks.

The recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but support for Redis and
databases is also available.
