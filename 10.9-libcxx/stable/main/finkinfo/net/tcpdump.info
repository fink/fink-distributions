# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Dump traffic on a network
DescDetail: <<
This program allows you to dump the traffic on a network. tcpdump is
able to examine IPv4, ICMPv4, IPv6, ICMPv6, UDP, TCP, SNMP, AFS BGP,
RIP, PIM, DVMRP, IGMP, SMB, OSPF, NFS and many other packet types.

It can be used to print out the headers of packets on a network
interface, filter packets that match a certain expression. You can use
this tool to track down network problems, to detect "ping attacks" or to
monitor network activities.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Explicitly disable libsmi support because there is currently no smi package
 in Fink, and this way we avoid accidental hidden dependencies if there
 is one in the future.
