	DescUsage: <<
In order to run net-snmp correctly, the community name needs to be set. The
easiest way to set this is to run the 'snmpconf' program, allowing you to
setup the various net-snmp configuration files.

You can use the "daemonic" program to set snmpd to be run automatically.
The service-name is "net-snmp-unified" for a variety of compatibility and
technical reasons on OS X up through 10.6 and "net-snmp-snmpd" on OS X 10.7.
Likewise, the package containing the daemon and other programs is is called
"net-snmp-unified" up through 10.6 and "net-snmp-bin" on 10.7.

Note: the perl modules allowing perl programs to access net-snmp
programs and libraries have been removed from this package. They will
some day be revived in a separate package.

DescDetail: <<
The net-snmp package, previously known as ucd-snmp, provides tools 
and libraries relating to SNMP. It provides SNMP libraries (the
libnetsnmp35-dev and libnetsnmp35-shlibs packages), an SNMP
daemon and tools to request and set information (the net-snmp-bin
package), and other features.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Customised install script to put files in correct directories.

Logfile set to %p/var/log/snmpd.log

Persistent directory set to %p/var/lib/snmp
(allows sharing with other snmp and similar to Debian's choice of /var/lib/snmp)

Default snmp version set to 3, but can be overridden using the '-v' flag for
the command tools, or alternatively using the 'defVersion' option in the
snmp.conf file.

As of packaging of libversion30, scrap the static-libs. All symbols in
.dylib are resolved via dyld. So no need to propagate -l flags for
internally-used dependencies (reduces inherited BuildDepends)

dmacks added a Makefile.PL hack to make sure the perlmods link against
the builddir rather than an existing installed fink- or apple-supplied
libnetsnmp suite (use direct paths to library files rather than
relying on -l via local -L, where the ordering could be hard to
control and not "fail" even if the library somehow didn't get built).
But at least this solution is a more technically correct way than the
flag-sort crutch we used to have in the net-snmp package suites.

dmacks (5.7.1-3): killed off the perlmods. They appear to be bindings
for external programs to use net-snmp and its libs and it is compiled,
so it would be better as a separate package with normal perlversioning
and varianting controls. Embedded perl has never been enabled
(disabled by default on OS X).

DescPort: <<
Based on the net-snmp package developed by Justin Hallett and Jeremy Higgs.

2012-05-03:
TheSin: -Bumped to %v 5.7.1 aka libversion 30
	-Removed unified from name and variants, on 10.7 removed
	 obsolete packages that never existed (no upgrade route)
	-renamed lib and dev from 25 to 30 and using libnetsnmp
	-Changed link from darwin9.h to darwin11.h from 10.7
	-Changed link from darwin9.h to darwin12.h from 10.8
	-Had to add -I/System/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE
	 to CFLAGS on the make line, though this should get generated?
	-Patch configure so it knows about and uses darwin[11|12] properly
2013-12-06:
nieder: bumped to %v 5.7.2
	- this release now knows up to darwin12
	- Remove portability links except for new one for darwin13 (10.9)

	dmacks: disabled a test that breaks for certain ISPs. See:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/bugs/2748/

2019-11-24:
nieder: bumped to %v 5.8
	- this release knows up to darwin17
	- bump to openssl110
	- disabled com2sec6 test that fails when an ISP wildcards nonexistent domains
