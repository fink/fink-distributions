DescDetail: <<
MQ (ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but
acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry
whole messages across various transports like in-process,
inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with
patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task distribution, and
request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered
products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore
applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a
score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems.

DescPort: <<
On 10.11 and earlier, -Werror,unused-const-variable is turned on, which
causes a build failure in src/clock.cpp::nsecs_per_usec. Turn if off
everywhere for simplicity. Should have no effec on 10.12+.
