Description: Tool to encrypt TCP connections
DescDetail: <<
Allows you to encrypt arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL. It can
allow you to secure non-SSL aware daemons and protocols (like POP, 
IMAP, LDAP, etc) by having it provide the encryption, requiring no 
changes to the daemon's code.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you want to use stunnel to secure services you need an .pem file. To have 
it seperated from the openssl files it is stored in %p/etc/stunnel. You can 
easily create it using openssl. e.g. (one line:) openssl req  -new -x509 -days 
365 -out %p/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem -keyout  %p/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem 
then openssl x509 -subject -dates -fingerprint -noout -in 
%p/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem It is a good idea to look at the stunnel homepage 
and in %p/share/doc/stunnel4 for more information.
<<
DescPort: <<
To avoid interactivity in the install process there must be no .pem file created.
This has to be done later if stunnel is meant to be used secure services, could
be needed in some cases stunnel is used as client.
