Description: Bandwidth monitor
DescDetail: <<
 bmon is an interface bandwidth monitor.
 It is able to generate and draw three types of diagrams:
 - The overview diagram which is a list of all interfaces and their  
   send/receive rates.
 - A very MRTG like graphical diagram in ASCII showing the rate over  
   a specific time period in a bar diagram.
 - The details diagram which contains all counters of an interface  
   such as total bytes sent/received, errors, compressed packets.
