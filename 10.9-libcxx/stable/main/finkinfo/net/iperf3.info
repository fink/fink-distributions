DescDetail: <<
iperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable
bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters
related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the
measured throughput / bitrate, loss, and other parameters.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
We only want the end user executable, so link against the static lib and
then axe it the lib and headers.
