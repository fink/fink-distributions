DescDetail: <<
 LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that often
 works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method) and goes
 through many configurations of packet-filters (firewalls). More importantly,
 LFT implements numerous other features including AS number lookups through
 several reliable sources, loose source routing, netblock name lookups, et al.
 What makes LFT unique? LFT is the all-in-one traceroute tool because it can
 launch a variety of different probes using ICMP, UDP, and TCP protocols, or
 the RFC1393 trace method. For example, rather than only launching UDP probes
 in an attempt to elicit ICMP "TTL exceeded" from hosts in the path, LFT can
 send TCP SYN or FIN probes to target arbitrary services. Then, LFT listens for
 "TTL exceeded" messages, TCP RST (reset), and various other interesting
 heuristics from firewalls or other gateways in the path. LFT also
 distinguishes between TCP-based protocols (source and destination), which make
 its statistics slightly more realistic, and gives a savvy user the ability to
 trace protocol routes, not just layer-3 (IP) hops. With LFT's verbose output,
 much can be discovered about a target network.

 This package also contains the "whob" whois client.

v3.33 note:
 Since the upstream developers make the source available only via a HTTP POST
 request, I have mirrored the source elsewhere.
