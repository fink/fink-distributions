DescDetail: <<
Command line applications which synchronize a local maildir-style
mailbox with a remote IMAP4 mailbox, suitable for use in disconnected
mode. Multiple copies of the remote IMAP4 mailbox can be maintained,
and all flags and messages are synchronized.

The main application was much improved in version 1.0. Those
improvements lead to interface changes and the application being
renamed to mbsync. The application isync is now only a wrapper to
keep compatibility with earlier versions.

Features:
 * Fast mode for fetching new mail only
 * Supports imaps: (port 993) TLS/SSL connections
 * Supports STARTTLS (RFC2595) for confidentiality
 * Supports NAMESPACE (RFC2342)
 * Supports CRAM-MD5 (RFC2095) for authentication
