DescPackaging: <<
	The application is in fact self-contained to a very large degree.
	"mupdf" symlink included for consistency with the man pages.

	dmacks: Build system mixes included and externally supplied
	flavors of several libs, which gives an unreliable build and
	unpredictable result. Use externals exclusively.

	dmacks: Hack the heck out of lcms external support (slightly
	higher BDep of lcms2mt2 to avoid a broken lcms2mt.pc that was
	transiently in fink)
