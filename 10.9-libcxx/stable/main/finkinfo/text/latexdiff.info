DescDetail: <<
latexdiff is a Perl script, which compares two latex files and marks
up significant differences between them (i.e. a diff for latex files).
Various options are available for visual markup using standard latex
packages such as 'color.sty'. Changes not directly affecting visible
text, for example in formatting commands, are still marked in the
latex source.

This package installs both 'latexdiff-ext' (which uses an external
diff module) and 'latexdiff-fast' (which uses the standard diff
utility); the default 'latexdiff' command is managed through the
update-alternatives system. You can change this default using e.g.
  sudo update-alternatives --set latexdiff `which latexdiff-fast`
See 'man update-alternatives' for more information.

A rudimentary revision facility is provided by another Perl script,
'latexrevise', which accepts or rejects all changes.  Manual editing
of the difference file can be used to override this default behaviour
and accept or reject selected changes only.
