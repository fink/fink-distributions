Description: GNU documentation system (legacy support)
DescDetail: <<
Texinfo is a documentation system that can render a single source file
into many representations for both on-line and print use. This package
contains both the generation utilities and the standalone 'info'
reader for the Info format.

Some packages need a makeinfo which is newer than what Apple provides even on
Mountain Lion, but yet still have .texi sources that are too loose in syntax 
for texinfo-5.0.  %n exists to handle these cases.
<<
DescUsage: <<
One typically needs this package for the 'makeinfo' executable, which is 
installed as %p/opt/%n/bin/makeinfo.  To make sure this version 
is used, either patch the build to find %p/opt/%n/bin/makeinfo 
explicitly, or put %p/opt/%n/bin at the beginning of the PATH
before building the docs (e.g. in the CompileScript).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The TeX files (texinfo.tex, txi-??.tex and epsf.tex) are not installed
right now. The teTeX package already has them.

Fink uses Debian's version of install-info (in the dpkg package);
texinfo's version is not installed.
