DescPort: <<
	zemberek is a plugin but forgot its -module flag

	Makefile variable-append syntax doesn't work so well in
	shell-interpretted configure script
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	ispell plugin loads dicts directly (not via %p/bin/ispell
	command) so aspell-compat is not viable alternative--it
	supplies %p/bin/ispell that uses aspell back-end dicts.  Can
	reduce strength of ispell dependency b/c it's runtime-detected
	and just one of several dict plugins (allows user to install
	aspell-compat command without dep deadlock).

	Don't care about dbus-glib because leaving zemberek disabled
	(default for that experimental backend)

Description: Generic spell-checking dictionary
DescDetail: <<
On the surface, Enchant appears to be a generic spell checking
library. You can request dictionaries from it, ask if a word is
correctly spelled, get corrections for a misspelled word, etc...

Beneath the surface, Enchant is a whole lot more - and less - than
that. You'll see that Enchant isn't really a spell checking library at
all.

"What's that?" you ask. Well, Enchant doesn't try to do any of the
work itself. It's lazy, and requires backends to do most of its dirty
work. Looking closer, you'll see the Enchant is more-or-less a fancy
wrapper around the dlopen() system call. Enchant steps in to provide
uniformity and conformity on top of these libraries, and implement
certain features that may be lacking in any individual provider
library. Everything should "just work" for any and every definition of
"just working."
