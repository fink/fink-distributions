DescDetail: <<
  Tofrodos is a text file conversion utility that converts ASCII and 
  Unicode UTF-8 files between the MSDOS (or Windows) format, which 
  traditionally have CR/LF (carriage return/line feed) pairs as their 
  new line delimiters, and the Unix format, which usually have LFs 
  (line feeds) to terminate each line.
