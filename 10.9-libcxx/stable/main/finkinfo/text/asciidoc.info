Description: Flexible, simple documentation markup system
DescDetail: <<
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing articles, books, manuals and
UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated to HTML (with or without
stylesheets), DocBook (articles, books and refentry documents) and LinuxDoc
using the asciidoc command. AsciiDoc can also be used to build and maintain
websites.

You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a
normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format notations.
AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or
translated to other presentation formats

In order to use a2x, you will need to install the asciidoc-a2x package, which
depends on libxslt-bin, w3m and/or lynx, and possibly 'fop'.

AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or

This package includes the a2x command, a DocBook toolchain wrapper script that
translates an AsciiDoc text file FILE to PDF, DVI, PS, LaTeX, XHTML (single
page or chunked), man page, HTML Help or plain text formats.
    <<
    DescUsage: <<
If you prefer to use FOP instead of dblatex to generate PDFs, install the 'fop'
package. FOP requires Java. However, at the time of writing, dblatex was not
available in Fink for all versions of OS X.
