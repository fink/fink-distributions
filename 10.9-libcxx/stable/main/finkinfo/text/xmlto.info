Description: Tool to convert xml files to other formats
DescDetail: <<
 The xmlto command is a front-end to an XSL toolchain. It chooses an
 appropriate stylesheet for the conversion you want and applies it using
 xsltproc. It also performs any necessary post-processing. The package
 also includes the xmlif script for conditional parsing.

 Supported formats are: dvi, fo, html, html-nochunks, htmlhelp,
 javahelp, man, pdf, ps, txt, xhtml, xhtml-nochunks from DocBook; and
 dvi, pdf, ps from xsl-fo.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The DVI, PDF and PostScript output formats require TeX to be installed.
 For these formats, it is also recommended that you install dblatex and
 use the --with-dblatex option.
<<
DescPort: <<
  Since TeX, fop, etc. may not be installed at build time, we force
  these paths. Also this makes the product independent of whether or not
  these packages were installed at build time. We do the same for the
  browsers since we only know that one of them is installed, which may
  not be the same one as at build time.
