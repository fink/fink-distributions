Description: Perl 5.16.2 subpackage for texi2html
DescDetail: <<
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk
and shell scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files,
and is especially good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are
practicality and efficiency.  While it is used to do a lot of
different things, Perl's most common applications are system
administration utilities and web programming.  A large proportion of
the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl.
<<
DescPort: <<
Because the perl build system is designed to download source files for
"extra" perlmodules directly from CPAN, we do not include those "extra" 
perlmodules in this package.  For that reason, the following packages
which are Provided by Apple's build of perl5.16.2 on 10.9 are not provided
here:
  convert-tnef-pm5162, html-parser-pm5162, 
  perl-objcbridge-pm5162, scalar-list-utils-pm5162, uri-pm5162, 
  algorithm-diff-pm5162, class-autouse-pm5162, corefoundation-pm5162, 
  data-hierarcy-pm5162, freezethaw-pm5162, io-pager-pm5162, 
  locale-maketext-lexicon-pm5162, perlio-eol-pm5162

"be_BY" locales are known broken on Darwin (at least through Darwin 12), so 
disable testing them.

Included Time::Local does bad assumptions for 2 digit years, which broke
starting in 2020. Patch adapted for perl5.1x from here:

On macOS11.0, buildtime miniperl is not properly referenced in some Makefiles.
So we hardcode the relative position for building.

DescUsage: <<
This package is for private use of the texi2html package only! It is
in a special nonstandard location, and omits or re-organizes some
standard user-facing components of a normal perl-interpretter package
suite.

DescPackaging: <<
 We now use lib/perl5-core as the main installation directory to avoid
 conflicts with fink-installed perl modules.

 This package is only supplied on dists where neither apple nor fink
 has perl-5.16. Fink's texi2html package is not compatible with
 perl-5.18, which is all apple has on 10.13+, and fink's perl5162
 FTBFS and there are legacy binary problem for the likely fix of that.
 Lots of components that texi2html does not need are omitted.
