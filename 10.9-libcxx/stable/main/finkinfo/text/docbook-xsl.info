DescDetail: <<
 XSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD (they are also completely
 compatible with the DocBook DSSSL DTD and the Simplified DocBook DTD).
<<
DescUsage: <<
 Obviously you need the DocBook DTD.
 If you want to process SGML files, you need also openjade and 
 probably both lpd and Norman Walsh dsssl stylesheets.
 Then if you want to use xsltproc, you have all installed already.
 If you want to use Saxon, you need to install it, and optionally
 (but recommended) Xerces, which provides additional features. 
 The documentation is installed in %p/share/doc/docbook-xsl.
 This release is mainly a bug fix release, though it has some
 new features and features changes: 
 1 - Support for profiling based on xml:lang and status
 2 - Initial support for footnotes, annnotation and alt in
 manpages
 3 - Default indexing method returned to "kosek"
 4 - Support for xml:base in xalan for db5 docs
 5 - Some changes in xmlns delcarations for saxon and xalan
 6 - Added append attributes in html to get newline character
 at the end of files
 See the release notes for more info:

DescPackaging: <<

Adding proper prefix to rm, cp, cat, and install so that there is no
problem with other versions of those tools installed elsewhere.
Added documentation
