Description: Building system for LaTeX documents
DescDetail: <<
This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs (hopefully) just as many compilations as necessary. The module system
provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with
no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, pdftex,
makeindex, cweb and graphics/graphicx (currently with automatic epstopdf and
XFig picture conversion and Metapost compilation).
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package can be used with non-Fink TeX distributions, so a dependency isn't
specified.  If you want to use a Fink TeX distribution, you'll need to install
it yourself.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Unlike the prior version, this installs modules.  The build system only uses Python 2.7.
<AKH> I'm insufficiently Python-savvy to figure out how to get it to use the system's 
Python properly--the --mod-dir configure parameter doesn't seem to do the right thing.

Doesn't explicitly encode paths to executables (e.g. 'latex'), but just uses
the first in the PATH, so we'll avoid declaring a dependency and let users 
install one themselves.

We manually regenerate the .pyc files to avoid hardcoding %i in them.
