Description: Converts texinfo documents to HTML
DescDetail: <<
Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project. It
uses a single source file to produce both on-line information and
printed output. For more details about texinfo, see
http://www.texinfo.org. 

In contrast to the HTML produced by 'makeinfo --html' (the 'makeinfo'
program is part of the Texinfo distribution), the HTML output of
'texi2html' is highly configurable. Among others, with 'texi2html' you 
can customize your entire page layout (like headers, footers, style
sheets, etc), split documents at various levels and use 'latex2html' to
convert @tex sections.

'texi2html' should reasonably convert all Texinfo 4.0 constructs. If
not, please send a bug report to 'texi2html@mathematik.uni-kl.de'.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses update-alternatives in case users also have texi2html installed via
tetex-base.

Any pkg that builddepends on this one, and calls it with the '-l2h' option,
must also BuildDepend on latex2html.

Previous versions by Christian Schaffner <chris01@users.sourceforge.net>

Disable some tests known to produce different output on darwin's
system perl.

Stick with perl5.16 (else fails self-tests, among other possible
reasons due to randomized hash ordering). On 10.9, /usr/bin/perl is
5.16; on 10.10+, /usr/bin/perl is 5.18 but on 10.10-10.12, there is
still /usr/bin/perl5.16 and that also exists back on 10.9. We
therefore hardcode /usr/bin/perl5.16 on 10.9-12 to reduce dependency
on fink's perl5162 for this low-level package. But perl5162 has build
problems on 10.14 whose only solution would propagate a binary (.deb)
variation into many -pm5162 packages so on 10.13 we use fink's but on
10.14 we have an onboard copy of perl5162 so fink doesn't need to (try
to) keep supporting an actual perl5162 suite.
