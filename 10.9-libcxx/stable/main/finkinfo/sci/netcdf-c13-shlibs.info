Description: Array-based data access, C library
DescDetail: <<
The netCDF (network Common Data Form) library defines a machine-independent
format for representing scientific data. Together, the interface, library,
and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.

This package provides libraries, documentation and examples for interfacing
with C code. 
For libraries, documentation and examples for interfacing
with C++ install the`netcdf-cxx4' package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Included examples in documents directory.

Disable remote DAP tests since we aren't supposed to be accessing remote data
during the build phase.
Disable CDF5 as recommended on Unidata website.

Feed -lsz to LDFLAGS so that the build finds libsz.

Disable building the static library.

DescPort: <<
CFLAGS=-O2 is essential to avoid debugging mode flags (-g).
<<
DescUsage: <<
Parallel netCDF now requires a parallel HDF5, which Fink doesn't
currently have, so this package doesn't build that option.

It is recommended that packages which build against %N should have versioned
dependencies on (%N >= 4.2.1.1-2) since prior versions didn't enforce 
rebuilding when HDF5 is updated, and this appears to be necessary.
