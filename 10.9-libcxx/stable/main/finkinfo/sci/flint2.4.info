# TODO: "make check" fails due to gmp 6 incompatibilities... we could
# work around this, but this is problematic, because most workarounds would
# be done during compile time... so if we do it, we probably need to up the GMP
# dependency to require GMP >= 6.0.0

Description: Library for doing number theory
DescDetail: <<
FLINT is a C library for doing number theory. It supports arithmetic
with numbers, polynomials, power series and matrices over many base
rings, including:

* Multiprecision integers and rationals
* Integers modulo n
* p-adic numbers
* Finite fields (prime and non-prime order)
* Real and complex numbers (via the Arb extension library)
<<
# TODO: Make an -mpir variant?
DescPackaging: <<
 According to the flint authors, the binary interface *should* not
 change between minor relases, but it still *might*. Hence the name of
 this package includes the full MAJOR.MINOR version (but not the
 patchlevel).

 Moreover, the shlibs produced by the flint buildsystem are not
 versioned. Hence we modify it to add a compatibility and current
 version based on MAJOR.MINOR.
 
 Finally, GMP 6 changed the documented behaviour of mpz_invert (yuck)
 so a patch is needed to make things work consistently across GMP
 versions.
