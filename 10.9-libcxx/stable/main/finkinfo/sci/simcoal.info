SIMCOAL (ver 1.0) is a computer program for the simulation of molecular 
genetic diversity in an arbitrary number of haploid populations examined 
for a set of fully linked loci. It is based on the retrospective 
coalescent approach initially described by Kingman (1982b; 1982a), and 
clearly exposed in a series of other papers (Ewens 1990; Hudson 1990; 
Donnelly and Tavare 1995). The coalescent backward approach does not 
simulate the genetic history of the whole population, like in conventional 
forward simulations, but rather reconstructs the gene genealogy 
(coalescent history) of samples of genes drawn from different demes in a 
population. For neutral genes, this coalescent process essentially depends 
on the history and on the demography of the population, and is independent 
from the mutational process. In our program, we simulate mutations 
starting from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all genes in the 
sample, and add them independently on all branches of the genealogy 
assuming a uniform and constant Poisson process. Using this two-step 
(coalescent-mutation) approach, many replicates of haploid samples of DNA 
sequences, RFLP, or microsatellite data can be simulated very quickly. The 
analysis of a large number of simulated samples allows one to obtain the 
empirical distribution of practically any statistic that can be derived 
from genetic data, including statistics for which no analytical derivation 
is available (Hudson 1993). Typical applications of our program include 
the study of the effect of complex demographies on the pattern of genetic 
diversity within and between populations, like in the case of bottlenecks, 
complex cases of admixture, or metapopulation systems. While our program 
generates haploid samples of genes or haplotypes, diploid data can be 
generated under the hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by taking 
random pairs of haplotypes to form diploid genotypes.
