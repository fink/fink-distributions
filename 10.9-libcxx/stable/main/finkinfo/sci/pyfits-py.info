DescDetail: <<
PyFITS provides an interface to FITS formatted files under Python. It
is useful both for interactive data analysis and for writing analysis
scripts in Python using FITS files as either input or output. PyFITS
is a development project of the Science Software Branch at the Space
Telescope Science Institute.
All of its functionality is now available in the Astropy package, and
STScI has announced to stop the development of PyFITS as an independent
library at some point in the future. Users are therefore encouraged to
switch to astropy rather sooner than later. This can be done as easy as
replacing your
import pyfits
with
from astropy.io import fits as pyfits 
<<
DescPort: <<
All tests should succeed. 2 utility scripts which are also provided by
astropy-pyXX packages.
