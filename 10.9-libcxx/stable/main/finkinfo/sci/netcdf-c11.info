DescDetail: <<
The netCDF (network Common Data Form) library defines a machine-independent
format for representing scientific data. Together, the interface, library,
and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.

This package provides libraries, documentation and examples for interfacing
with C code. 
For libraries, documentation and examples for interfacing
with C++ install the`netcdf-cxx4' package.
For libraries, documentation and examples for interfacing
with Fortran 77 (and Fortran 90) code install the `netcdf-fortran5' package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Included examples in documents directory.

Disable remote DAP tests since we aren't supposed to be accessing remote data
during the build phase.

Feed -lsz to configure so that it finds libsz.
Patch nc-config to find libsz.

Disable building the static library.

Bump revision when HDF5 version is updated.

Note: there are test failures when building against hdf5.100
(either API version).

DescPort: <<
CFLAGS=-O2 is essential to avoid debugging mode flags (-g).
<<
DescUsage: <<
Parallel netCDF now requires a parallel HDF5, which Fink doesn't
currently have, so this package doesn't build that option.

It is recommended that packages which build against %N should have versioned
dependencies on (%N >= 4.2.1.1-2) since prior versions didn't enforce 
rebuilding when HDF5 is updated, and this appears to be necessary.
