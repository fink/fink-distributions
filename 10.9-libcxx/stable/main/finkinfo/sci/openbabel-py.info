Description: Chemical data converter/analysis tools
DescDetail: <<
  Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a
  cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many
  file formats used in molecular modeling and computational chemistry.

DescPackaging: <<
	dmacks (as of 2.2.3-1): move modules to -shlibs (they are
	runtime-loaded by it, and in a versioned dirctory now).

	dmacks (as of 2.2.3-1): borrow Fedora's patch to use external
	libstdinchi (rather than expected libinchi)--it's same as
	included libinchi so no need to build local. But hack to
	*only* use libstdinchi (more deterministic than fallback to
	other). Also move included inchi_api.h out of the way so
	compiler doesn't find it (want external one)
