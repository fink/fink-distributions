DescDetail: <<
Tabix indexes a TAB-delimited genome position file in.tab.bgz and 
creates an index file in.tab.bgz.tbi when region is absent from the 
command-line. The input data file must be position sorted and 
compressed by bgzip which has a gzip(1) like interface. After 
indexing, tabix is able to quickly retrieve data lines overlapping 
regions specified in the format "chr:beginPos-endPos". Fast data 
retrieval also works over network if URI is given as a file name 
and in this case the index file will be downloaded if it is not 
present locally.
