Description: C++ library for eXtended Scientific Computing
DescDetail: <<
C-XSC is a tool for the development of numerical algorithms
delivering highly accurate and automatically verified results.
It provides a large number of predefined numerical data types
and operators. These types are implemented as C++ classes.
Thus, C-XSC allows high-level programming of numerical
applications in C and C++.

# Note: For now we are using the cmake build system. We could
# also try building with the autoconf/automake build system.
# Both are marked "experimental". Neither seems to be setup to
# build shared libraries. Oh well.
#
# TODO: tweak it to build a shared library
