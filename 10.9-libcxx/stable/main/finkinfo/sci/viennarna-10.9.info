Description: RNA structural prediction
DescDetail: <<
The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library 
and several stand-alone programs for the
prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures. 
The package allows you to
- predict minimum free energy secondary structures
- calculate the partition function for the ensemble of structures
- calculate suboptimal structures in a given energy range
- predict consensus secondary structures from a multiple sequence alignment
- predict melting curves
- search for sequences folding into a given structure
- compare two secondary structures 
-
The package includes a Perl5 module that gives access to almost all
functions of the C library from Perl. 
-
The following executables are provided in /sw/bin:

RNA2Dfold
Compute MFE structure, partition function and representative sample structures
of k,l neighborhoods

RNAaliduplex
Predict conserved RNA-RNA interactions between two alignments

RNAalifold
Calculate secondary structures for a set of aligned RNA sequences

RNAcofold
Calculate secondary structures of two RNAs with dimerization

RNAdistance
Calculate distances between RNA secondary structures

RNAduplex
Compute the structure upon hybridization of two RNA strands

RNAeval
Evaluate free energy of RNA sequences with given secondary structure

RNAfold
Calculate minimum free energy secondary structures and partition function of
RNAs

RNAheat
Calculate the specific heat (melting curve) of an RNA sequence

RNAinverse
Find RNA sequences with given secondary structure (sequence design)

RNALalifold
Calculate locally stable secondary structures for a set of aligned RNAs

RNALfold
Calculate locally stable secondary structures of long RNAs

RNApaln
RNA alignment based on sequence base pairing propensities

RNApdist
Calculate distances between thermodynamic RNA secondary structures ensembles

RNAparconv
Convert energy parameter files from ViennaRNA 1.8 to 2.0 format

RNAPKplex
Predict RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots

RNAplex
Find targets of a query RNA

RNAplfold
Calculate average pair probabilities for locally stable secondary structures

RNAplot
Draw RNA Secondary Structures in PostScript, SVG, or GML

RNAsnoop
Find targets of a query H/ACA snoRNA

RNAsubopt
Calculate suboptimal secondary structures of RNAs

RNAup
Calculate the thermodynamics of RNA-RNA interactions


Several small but helpful Perl Utilities are in /sw/share/ViennaRNA/bin
which is not added to your PATH by default.  These include the following:
 
ct2db
Produce dot bracket notation of an RNA secondary structure given as 
mfold .ct file

b2mt.pl
Produce coordinates for a mountain plot from bracket notation

cmount.pl
Produce a colored mountain plot of a consensus structure

coloraln.pl
Colorize an alignment with consensus structure

colorrna.pl
Colorize an alirna.ps file

mountain.pl
Produce coordinates for a mountain plot from a dot plot

refold.pl
Refold using consensus structure as constraint

relplot.pl
Annotate a secdonary structure plot with reliability information

rotate_ss.pl
Rotate or mirror coordinates of secondary structure plot

switch.pl
Design bistable RNA sequences
