Software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large 
reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three 
algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm 
is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest 
two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW 
share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, 
but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-
quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has 
better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.
