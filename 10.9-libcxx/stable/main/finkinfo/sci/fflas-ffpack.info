# Anything that bdeps on fflas-ffpack must effectively also bdep on the
# bdeps of fflas-ffpack.
#
# But note that fflas-ffpack consist of only headers, hence it has
# no dependencies of its own.

Description: Finite Field Linear Algebra Subroutines
DescDetail: <<
FFLAS-FFPACK is a LGPL source code library for dense linear
algebra over word-size finite fields.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* FFLAS-FFPACK relies on a BLAS library. This package is hard-coded to
  use Apple's Accelerate Framework. If you need to use it with another
  BLAS, e.g. Atlas, GSL, Lapack..., it should be possible to make a
  variant of this package supporting that. Please contact the maintainer
  if you are interested in this.

* we disable givaro support for now. Future versions of FFLAS-FFPACK use
  it, but only for the test suite. Once that happens, we will have to make
  sure that fflas-ffpack-config.h is cleaned up before installation,
  otherwise it could differ depending on whether tests where run or not.

* comment out unused OMPTimer class (required OpenMP), to allow tests to run
