Package: qhull5-shlibs
Version: 2009.1.1
Revision: 6
Distribution: 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14, 10.14.5, 10.15
Description: Calculate convex hulls and related structures
License: BSD
Maintainer: None <fink-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
DescDetail: <<
Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace 
intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site 
Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. 
It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements 
the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull 
handles roundoff errors from floating point arithmetic. It 
computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to the 
convex hull.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package contains the shared library.
<<
DescPort: <<
Get rid of Windows line endings in some scripts.

Compiler dependency checking doesn't work right, so feed the canonical
gcc3.3 to configure.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
-shlibs only stub.

Previous maintainer: Alexander Hansen

Builds with -fno-strict-aliasing because upstream notes that leaving
it out can cause segfaults in the qhull executable.
The prior static-only qhull package was maintained by Stefan Langerman 
<fink@slef.org>.
