DescDetail: << 
This package installs alternate ccp4-setup shell environment files to be used 
with CCP4 version 6.5 installed from the CCP4 distributed installer package. 
These files are changed slightly from those distributed by CCP4 to (a) avoid 
conflicts witih the Fink environment, (b) to provide a set of customized 
command-line completions for zsh shell users, (c) to provide an environment 
setup that can be used with both bash and zsh without requiring manual editing,
and (d) to allow imosflm to run with the system distributed aqua-based tcltk. 
. 
CCP4 now provides a self-contained installer and update system, and no longer 
provides source-code updates or patches between releases, making maintenance of
a fink- installed version of CCP4 untenable. CCP4 now distributes 64-bit 
binaries as of version 6.5, so users no longer need to install a the fink 
package to obtain a 64-bit version of CCP4. . CCP4 has released a set of 
libraries under the LGPL. These are provided in the following fink packages: 
libccp4, clipper, mmdb, ssm. Fink packages for the CCP4-associated programs 
refmac, xia2 and coot are also provided, as is an mpi version of the molecular
replacement program phaser.
