DescPackaging: <<
Version 2.16.0 has a "Complex" struct in its public API which collides with Octave's "Complex"
which is a typedef from std::complex<double>.  Unfortunately, only the compat version was
incremented, and not the libversion.  We therefore introduce a new name and install in 
a private directory to allow coexistence with the library from version 2.15.0.

Disable IDL binding because I can't control whether folks have that or not.
Feel free to enable it locally :-)

Disable Python and Perl bindings to allow for multiple -pm and -py versions.

Disable Fortran bindings so that people can elect to build them if they need them
rather than forcing them to install gcc4N if they don't.

Enable Java bindings because Java is included with the OS.

Builds the Lua binding if lua51 is installed, so require that as a dependency.

Use install_name_tool on the java lib so that it has an absolute install_name. 

The text files are in the -shlibs package because they are used at runtime.
