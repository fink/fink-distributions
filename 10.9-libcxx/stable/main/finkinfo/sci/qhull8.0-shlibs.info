Package: qhull8.0-shlibs
Version: 2020.2
Revision: 2
Description: Calculate convex hulls and related structures
License: BSD
Maintainer: None <fink-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
DescDetail: <<
Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace 
intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site 
Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. 
It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements 
the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull 
handles roundoff errors from floating point arithmetic. It 
computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to the 
convex hull.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package contains the shared libraries.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* Previous maintainer: Alexander Hansen
* The prior static-only qhull package was maintained by Stefan Langerman 
  <fink@slef.org>.
* Patch library install_name to be a full and not relative path.
* Steal some debian patches, especially to retain the legacy libqhull
  from older versions that upstream says it will continue to support,
  not just the new libqhull_r. This allows easy migration from older
  package libversions. Also their patch to convert libqhullcpp to
  shared (rather than static). If you need either the legacy lib or
  the cpp lib, be sure you depend on package-version 2020.2-2
  (2020.2-1 only had the _r library).
