Description: I/O library for 2D X-ray images
DescDetail: <<
FabIO is an I/O library for images produced by 2D X-ray detectors and
written in Python.  FabIO support images detectors from a dozen of
companies (including Mar, Dectris, ADSC, Hamamatsu, Oxford, ...), for a
total of 20 different file formats (like CBF, EDF, TIFF, ...)  and offers
an unified interface to their headers (as a python dictionary) and datasets
(as a numpy ndarray of integers or floats)
