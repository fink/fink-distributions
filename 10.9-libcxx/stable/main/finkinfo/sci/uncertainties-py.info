DescDetail: <<
Uncertainties allows calculations such as (2 +/- 0.1)*2 = 4 +/- 0.2 to be
performed transparently while handling error propagation and correlation
between variable. Much more complex mathematical expressions involving
numbers with uncertainties can also be evaluated directly.
The module can also yield the derivatives of any expression. 
Integration with NumPy is provided by replacements of many NumPy functions
and the possibility to create NumPy arrays from uncertainty objects.
