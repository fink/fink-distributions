Description: 3D finite element mesh generator
DescDetail: <<
 Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily
 Delaunay) with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its
 design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
 cases with parametric input and up to date visualization
 capabilities.

 Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
 post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is
 done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in
 ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
 
 See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's 
 capabilities.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package contains the '%n' executable, an app bundle, and documentation
including demos and tutorial material.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Needs a texinfo which is newer than the system's version.

	Executable is built statically from the object files directly, rather than
	via libraries, so there is no dependency on gmsh2.8-shlibs.

	Patch to install docs in their proper locations when using "make install".  
	Thanks to Nicholas Taylor for the original form of the patch.  
	
	The app bundle build takes a lot of manual fiddling.

	Uses vecLib for BLAS.  (we patch this to Accelerate)
	It appears not to use Fink's ATLAS even when that's 
	installed, so no -atlas variant currently.

	Python binding is currently disabled because the package tries to mix Apple and
	Fink Pythons.
	
	No METIS or TETGEN support because of their license limitations.

	Unset MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET because newer cmake doesn't like it
	when it and OSX_SYSROOT mismatch (as when only the command line tools
	are installed).
