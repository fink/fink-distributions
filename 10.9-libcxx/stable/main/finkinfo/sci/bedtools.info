DescDetail: <<
The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as 
finding feature overlaps and computing coverage. The utilities are largely 
based on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and SAM/BAM. 
Using BEDTools, one can develop sophisticated pipelines that answer 
complicated research questions by "streaming" several BEDTools together. 
The following are examples of common questions that one can address with 
BEDTools.

    Intersecting two BED files in search of overlapping features.
    Culling/refining/computing coverage for BAM alignments based on genome 
features.
    Merging overlapping features.
    Screening for paired-end (PE) overlaps between PE sequences and 
existing genomic features.
    Calculating the depth and breadth of sequence coverage across defined 
"windows" in a genome.
    Screening for overlaps between "split" alignments and genomic features.
