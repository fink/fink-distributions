Description: RNA database search with structure queries
DescDetail: <<
Sequence database searching with RNA structure queries.
RSEARCH aligns an RNA query to target sequences, using SCFG 
algorithms to score both secondary structure and primary
sequence alignment simultaneously. It's slow, but somewhat more 
capable of finding significant remote RNA structure homologies 
than sequence alignment methods like BLAST. (By "slow", we mean, 
you really need a substantial computing cluster to do any 
serious work with it; a typical single search of a metazoan genome may
take a few thousand CPU hours.) This install will rename rsearch to rnasearch
to avoid conflict with ccp4's rsearch.
