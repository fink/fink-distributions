Package: qhull6.3.1-shlibs
Version: 2012.1
Revision: 6
Description: Calculate convex hulls and related structures
License: BSD
Maintainer: None <fink-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
DescDetail: <<
Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace 
intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site 
Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. 
It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements 
the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull 
handles roundoff errors from floating point arithmetic. It 
computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to the 
convex hull.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	This package contains the shared libraries.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Upstream doesn't appear to grok OS X, so we handcraft the dylibs' 
	install_name.
	Upstream decided to refactor and re-release version 2012.1, but
	with new soname.
	Apply patch from https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports?view=revision&revision=374949
	to address errors  of the form:

	In file included from src/libqhullcpp/QhullPoint.h:15:
src/libqhullcpp/Coordinates.h:154:22: error: reference to
      'random_access_iterator_tag' is ambiguous
        typedef std::random_access_iterator_tag  iterator_category;
                     ^
	
	which were introduced by Xcode 6.3.
