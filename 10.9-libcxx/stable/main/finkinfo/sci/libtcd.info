Description: API to read/write TCD files (dev. files)
DescDetail: <<
libtcd provides a software API for reading and writing Tide Constituent 
Database (TCD) files.

The TCD file format and schema are used by XTide to retrieve constituent 
definitions (speeds, equilibrium arguments, and node factors), harmonic 
constants, subordinate station offsets and associated metadata for use in 
generating tide predictions.

The TCD file format and schema were originally designed by Jan Depner to 
improve the performance of XTide and to meet additional requirements of the
U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO).  They are now maintained primarily by
David Flater.

The design goals for TCD included:

Available without installing heavy external packages.
Efficient for indexing and loading of stations.
Compact file format.
Translatable without loss from legacy XTide .txt and .xml files.
Exportable to legacy .txt and .xml formats.
Modifiable by end user using tideEditor.
Able to detect tampering (usually, misguided attempts to edit the database in
a word processor).
The TCD file format and schema and libtcd are in the public domain.  They are
distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; 
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Atmospheric Master Library (OAML) Tide Constituent Database," rev. 2003-06-06.
