Package: xraylib
Version: 2.15.0
Revision: 4

Description:  X-ray fluorescence library (build-time)
DescDetail: <<
X-ray matter interaction cross sections for X-ray fluorescence applications. 
It is a C library with also Python, IDL, PERL and Fortran interfaces. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
The Octave Forge xraylib package is currently incompatible with xraylib-2.16.0,
so this package exists to provide the ability to build that.

DescPackaging: <<
Disable IDL binding because I can't control whether folks have that or not.
Feel free to enable it locally :-)

Disable Python and Perl bindings to allow for multiple -pm and -py versions.

Disable Fortran bindings so that people can elect to build them if they need them
rather than forcing them to install gcc4N if they don't.

Enable Java bindings because Java is included with the OS.

Use install_name_tool on the java lib so that it has an absolute install_name. 

Patch examples/Makefile.in so that test 7 in the test suite uses the the same
architecture for the Java virtual machine as the Fink tree.

The text files are in the -shlibs package because they are used at runtime.
