Description: Molecular Biology Open Software Suite
DescDetail: <<
EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially
developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user
community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of
formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from the
web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package, it is a
platform to allow other scientists to develop and release software in
true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently
available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless
whole.
<<
DescUsage: <<
See the README file for other environment variables you may need to
configure. See http://emboss.sourceforge.net/Jemboss/ for
information on using the Jemboss GUI for EMBOSS. To prevent conflicts,
the headers are located in %p/lib/EMBOSS/include instead of %p/include.

Install kemboss-qt4-mac or kemboss-qt4-x11 for a GUI that works either
in Aqua or X11 respectively or emboss-kaptain for a different X11 GUI.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Add explicit linking to libs that supply symbols used by the
	shared libraries here. This prevents things that link against
	the shared libraries from having to know to pass additional
	flags when the linker requires all symbols be defined.

	Home-grown hack mis-passes things and isn't portable. But we
	don't need it because we're using system plplot so omit rather
	than fix.

	Fink plplot doesn't have plxsfnam(), which takes separate
	filename and extension, so hack ajgraph.c to use plfnam(),
	which takes single filename.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Former Maintainer: Koen van der Drift <driftkop@users.sourceforge.net>

	There have been a ton of Shlibs Policy problems. As of
	6.3.1-101, making clean break with new library package-names
	and install_names (via never-before-used --libdir and parallel
	--includedir) and no attempt to retain symlinks for -dev or
	-shlibs since old pkgs are not necessarily compatible with
	these new ones.

	And upstream apparently breaks API and ABI regularly. Debian
	has declared the whole shared-library set as private and then
	manually handles reverse-dependency propagation of versioned
	dependencies at each update. We don't have that manpower, so
	we'll just unify the libs and headers in a release-versioned
	package-name.

	Hack configure and Makefiles to consider external plplot and
	expat library as other systemlibs.

	Make sure pg flags get passed early so specific-version buried
	-I and -L supercede unpredictably-versioned ones in default
	locations.
