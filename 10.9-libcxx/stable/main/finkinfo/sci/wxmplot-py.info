Description: Plotting widgets for wxPython with matplotlib

DescDetail: <<
The wxmplot python package provides easy-to-use, richly featured plotting
widgets for wxPython built on top of the wonderful matplotlib library.
While matplotlib provides excellent general purpose plotting functionality,
and supports a variety of GUI and non-GUI backends, it does not have a very
tight integration with any particular GUI toolkit.  Similarly, while
wxPython has some plotting functionality, it has nothing as good as
matplotlib.  The wxmplot package attempts to bridge this gap, providing
wx.Panels for basic 2D line plots and image display that are richly
featured and provide end-users with interactivity (zooming, reading
positions, rotating images) and customization (line types, labels, marker
type, colors, and color tables) of the graphics without having to know
matplotlib.  Wxmplot does not expose all of matplotlib's capabilities, but
does provide 2D plotting and image display Panels and Frames can be used
simply in wxPython applications to handle many use cases.
