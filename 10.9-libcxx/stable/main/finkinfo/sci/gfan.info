  which are polyhedral fans associated to polynomial ideals. It contains many
  tools which are useful in the study of Grobner bases, initial ideals, and
  tropical geometry.

DescPort: <<
  The patch change the Makefile to use dynamic libraries instead of static ones.
  In addition, it changes the installlinks command to create links with relative
  instead of absolute paths, which would break when fink unpacks the deb
  archive. The other changes are mostly fixes to warnings given by clang.
