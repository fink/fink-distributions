Description: Interface to the netCDF version 4 library
DescDetail: <<
netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the
library, such as hierarchical groups, zlib compression, multiple unlimited
dimensions, and new data types.  It is implemented on top of HDF5.  This
module implements most of the new features, and can read and write netCDF
files compatible with older versions of the library.  The API is modelled
after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that module.
