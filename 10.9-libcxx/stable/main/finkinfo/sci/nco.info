DescDetail: <<
	Each NCO operator (e.g., ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s),
	performs an operation (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming),
	and outputs a processed netCDF file. Although most users of
	netCDF and HDF data are involved in scientific research,
	these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
	are equally useful in fields like finance.
	
	This version is OPeNDAP/DODS enabled, so it can be given
	URLs to read remote datasets as if they were local netCDF files.

Former Maintainer: Alexander Hansen <alexkhansen@users.sourceforge.net>

Because no Fink package links against the nco library, Fink maintainers
have decided to build a private shared library only (and not a static
one to avoid many large executables). The -shlibs and -dev packages
have thus been scrapped since version 4.7.0. See:
https://sourceforge.net/p/fink/package-submissions/5063/
