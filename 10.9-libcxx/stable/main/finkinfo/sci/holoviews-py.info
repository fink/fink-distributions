Description: Data analysis, time series,and statistics
DescDetail: <<
Providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to
make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially
heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It aims
to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical,
real world data analysis in Python.

directories on https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/tree/master/doc
<<
DescPort: <<
ca. 80 errors, 12-15 failures in nosetests, largely due to missing support
modules bokeh, iris and xarray. Tests will fail almost immediately if ipython
is not installed; pandas and matplotlib also made TestDepends for consistent
test results.
