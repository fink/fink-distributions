GNU Units converts quantities expressed in various systems of
measurement to their equivalents in other systems of measurement. Like
many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative scale changes. It
can also handle nonlinear conversions such as Fahrenheit to Celsius or
wire gauge, and it can convert from and to sums of units, such as
converting between meters and feet plus inches.

Beyond simple unit conversions, GNU Units can be used as a
general-purpose scientific calculator that keeps track of units in its
calculations. You can form arbitrary complex mathematical expressions
of dimensions including sums, products, quotients, powers, and even
roots of dimensions. Thus you can ensure accuracy and dimensional
consistency when working with long expressions that involve many
different units that may combine in complex ways.

The units are defined in an external data file. You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can provide
your own data file to suit your needs. You can also use your own data
file to supplement the standard data file.
