DescDetail: <<
RPy is a very simple, yet robust, interface to the R Programming Language.
It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R functions
(including the graphic functions). All the errors from the R language are 
converted to Python exceptions. 

RPy2 is a redesign/rewrite of RPy, providing not only high-level interfaces
to R but also a lower-level interface upon which build custom high-level
interfaces.

Doesn't work with quartz graphics device (need a Framework build of python 
for that).
<<
DescPort: <<
Added singledispatch-py dependency for py27 type.
Patched setup.py to find R executable in %p/Library/Frameworks, but it has
to be in PATH at runtime, therefore r-base dependency.
1-2 test errors; possibly requires cran-ggplot2-r32 (>= 2.0.0) to succeed.
