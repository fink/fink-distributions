Description: Open Visualization Data Explorer
DescDetail: <<
Open Visualization Data Explorer is a full visualization environment that 
gives users the ability to apply advanced visualization and analysis
techniques to their data. These techniques can be applied to help users 
gain new insights into data from applications in a wide variety of fields
including science, engineering, medicine and business. Data Explorer
provides a full set of tools for manipulating, transforming, processing, 
realizing, rendering and animating data and allow for visualization and 
analysis methods based on points, lines, areas, volumes, images or geometric
primitives in any combination. Data Explorer is discipline-independent and
easily adapts to new applications and data. The integrated object-oriented
graphical user interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use.

DescPort: <<
The original program installed itself in %p/dx/, which is against fink policy.
Various makefile.am  were modified so that fink installed the bulk of the
program in %p/share/dx, while installing binaries, includes, manfiles, etc.
 in %p/bin, %p/include, %p/share/man etc. Using %p/lib breaks things, so 
I've left the "libraries"  in %/p/share/dx/lib. 
Disables java dx.
Fixed the -morehelp option.
Corrected configure.ac so all necesary hdf libaries are compiled in.
Placed a symbolic link between %p/include and %p/share/dx/include to aid in 
porting downstream packages with "smart" configure scripts.

Adds work around discussed in Apple Technical Q&A 1567:Compiling X11/ OpenGL 
applications on Mac OS X v.10.5 Leopard. Fixes  StartWebBrowser.C to compile 
with Leopard's ApplicationServices.h

Patch to allow compiling if ImageMagick was built with --enable-hdri
(require positive int for array subscript in _im_image.c). See:
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php

akh: patch instances of "argc" to be an int rather than
	 unsigned int to keep clang happy.
     patch _im_image.c to deal with a change in the ImageMagick API (shocker!)
     cf.:
     https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/transcode/+bug/539106

Needs flat-namespace libXt for compatibility with openmotif4
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	dmacks: Hack configure to use whatever libs ImageMagick
	publishes instead of hardcoded guessing.

	dmacks: hdf (v4) requires g95, but switching dx to use hdf5
	seems non-trivial. Use dx-hdf5 to add support for newer hdf*
	functionality into dx.

	dmacks: hdf may enable szip as well as jpeg but is still
	static-only so have to pass its dep-libs linker flags.

	Upstream patch for subscript typos in lbcamera.c:
	http://www.opendx.org/cgi-bin/forum/YaBB.pl?num=1151354542/1

	Debian patches:
	  50-dxgeterror-fix.patch
	  50-format-security-fix.patch

	XQuartz-2.8.0 dropped libXp compile-time files (only retained
	the runtime dylib); disable detection in order to get
	deterministic results.
