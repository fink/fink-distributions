Description: Harmonic Inversion of Time Signals
DescDetail: <<
 Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the 
 problem of "harmonic inversion."  Given a discrete, finite-length
 signal that consists of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly
 exponentially decaying), it determines the frequencies, decay
 constants, amplitudes, and phases of those sinusoids.
