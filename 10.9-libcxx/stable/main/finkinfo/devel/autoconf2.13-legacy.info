Description: System for generating configure scripts
DescDetail: <<
GNU Autoconf is a package for generating configure scripts.
These scripts are present in a large number of free software packages
and are used to detect system features at compilation time.

This package installs Autoconf 2.13. There are newer versions
available, but there are some compatibility problems and some packages
require version 2.13. To get one of the new versions, install the
autoconf package instead.

Patch to have X11 path-check check for X itself (not subpackage that
might be somewhere else). See:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2005-09/msg00023.html

Patch to support OS X shared-library extension. See:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2008-03/msg00071.html

Patch to support xquartz X11 location. See:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2015-06/msg00023.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2015-08/msg00002.html
Giving precedence to older-standard locations because that's what we
have always expected/supported--retain behavior on existing platforms.
We just now also support the new-standard location if no old one.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package buries its programs and data-files in %p/lib/autoconf2.13
to avoid colliding with the more modern autoconf packages.
