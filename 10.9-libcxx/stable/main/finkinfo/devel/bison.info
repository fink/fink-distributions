Description: Parser generator
DescDetail: <<
Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
description for an LALR context-free grammar into a C program to parse
that grammar. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to
develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple
desk calculators to complex programming languages.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.

locale.alias is deleted because it is already provided by gettext which
is an essential package, hence we can rely on the file to be always present.

The only C++ is in the self-test suite.

Force use of the system's java at build time because otherwise the package
will find gcj from gcc4N, if installed.

With format string strictness, High Sierra also enforces that %n isn't
used in dynamic format strings, but we should just disable its use on
darwin in general.
