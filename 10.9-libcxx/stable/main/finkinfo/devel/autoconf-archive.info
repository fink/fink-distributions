Description: Freely re-usable Autoconf macros
DescDetail: <<
	The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 450 macros for
	GNU Autoconf that have been contributed as free software by friendly
	supporters of the cause from all over the Internet. Every single one of
	those macros can be re-used without imposing any restrictions
	whatsoever on the licensing of the generated configure script. In
	particular, it is possible to use all those macros in configure scripts
	that are meant for non-free software. This policy is unusual for a Free
	Software Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that software
	ought to be free, and software licenses like the GPL are specifically
	designed to ensure that derivative work based on free software must be
	free as well. In case of Autoconf, however, an exception has been made,
	because Autoconf is at such a pivotal position in the software
	development tool chain that the benefits from having this tool
	available as widely as possible outweigh the disadvantage that some
	authors may choose to use it, too, for proprietary software.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	We don't depend on any autoconf or automake packages, but obviously
	any package using this will need to do so to do anything useful with it.
