# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
kRev is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS, Subversion and
Git configuration management systems. It will also help with RCS. It
shows the status of the files in the current working directory, and has
tools for tagging, merging, checking in/out, and other user operations.
TkDiff is included for browsing and merging your changes.

TkRev also aids in browsing the repository. For Subversion, the
repository tree is browsed like an ordinary file tree. For Git, the
branches and tags are listed. For CVS, the CVSROOT/modules file is read.
TkRev extends CVS with a method to produce a "user friendly" listing of
modules by using special comments in the CVSROOT/modules file.
 
The graphical 2 and 3-way diff/merge tool TkDiff is included in this
package and can be used by itself.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Remote repositories are supported, although the login step must 
be done at the commandline.

Then type 'tkrev' to start up TkCVS

You can put personal preferences in a file called .tkrev in your 
home directory.  User interface preferences should usually go there.

Type 'man tkcvs' to get help.
Type 'tkdiff' and open the help menu for more information about TkDiff.
