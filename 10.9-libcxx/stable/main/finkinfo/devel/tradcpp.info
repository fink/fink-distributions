DescDetail: <<
The tradcpp command provides a traditional K&R-style C macro
preprocessor. It is intended to be suitable for historical Unix uses of
the preprocessor, such as imake, particularly those that depend on
preservation of whitespace.
The chief ways in which traditional cpp differs from Standard C are:

* Macro arguments are expanded within quoted strings. There is no
stringize operator.
* There is no token pasting operator; tokens can be concatenated by
placing comments between them. This process is also not limited to valid
C language tokens.
* Whitespace is preserved, and in particular tabs are not expanded into
spaces. Furthermore, additional whitespace is not injected.

DescUsage: <<
Packages that BuildDepend on xmkmf will most likely need to BuildDepend on 
this package as well.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Designed to be built with bsdmake, but since we don't have it, manually
run the Makefile commands that bsdmake would.
