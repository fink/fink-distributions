DescDetail: <<
F77chk is written in Perl and checks consistencies of arguments at every 
calls to externals in source files.   Including definition files, in which 
definitions of externals in libraries are listed, entire consistencies of 
arguments can be checked to reduce run time errors.   A definition file 
for a library can be generated by f77chk automatically if the source code 
is available, or by hand referring user's manuals, for example. 
<<

DescUsage: <<
Simply do:

  f77chk.pl [options] file1 ...

for further details see the README files in %p/share/doc/f77chk/
<<

DescPort: <<
Changed the position of library.def from the executable directory to 
%p/etc/library.def.
