Description: Beautifier/Reformatter of C, C++, C# & Java
DescDetail: <<
Artistic Style is a source code indenter, formatter, and beautifier for
the C, C++, C# and Java programming languages.

When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use
both spaces and tab characters to create the wanted indentation.

Since the NUMBER of space characters showed on screen for each tab
character in the source code changes between editors, one of the
standard problems programmers are facing when moving from one editor to
another is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was up to now
perfectly indented, suddenly becomes a mess to look at when changing to
another editor.

To address this problem, Artistic Style was created - a filter written
in C++ that automatically re-indents and re-formats C / C++ / C# / Java
source files. It can be used from a command line, or it can be
incorporated as classes in another C++ program.
