Description: Berkeley YACC
DescDetail: <<
	Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc has been
	made as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.  Berkeley Yacc can
	accept any input specification that conforms to the AT&T Yacc
	documentation.  Specifications that take advantage of undocumented
	features of AT&T Yacc will probably be rejected.
	
	Berkeley Yacc (byacc) is generally conceded to be the best yacc variant
	available. In contrast to bison, it is written to avoid dependencies
	upon a particular compiler.
	
	byacc  provides  some  extensions for compatibility with bison and
	other implementations of yacc.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Rename program from 'yacc' to 'byacc' to avoid conflicting with bison.
	Debian does the same thing.
