Description: Parser generator
DescDetail: <<
Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
description for an LALR context-free grammar into a C program to parse
that grammar. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to
develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple
desk calculators to complex programming languages.

Some packages need a bison which is newer than what Apple provides even on
Mountain Lion, but yet still have .y sources that are too loose in syntax 
for bison-3.0.  %n exists to handle these cases.
<<
DescUsage: <<
One typically needs this package for the 'bison' and 'yacc' executables,
which are installed as %p/opt/%n/bin/bison.  To make sure these versions
are used, either patch the build to find %p/opt/%n/bin/[bison|yacc]
explicitly, or put %p/opt/%n/bin at the beginning of the PATH
before building the docs (e.g. in the CompileScript).

DescPackaging: <<
Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.

The only C++ is in the self-test suite.

Force use of the system's java at build time because otherwise the package
will find gcj from gcc4N, if installed.

With format string strictness, High Sierra also enforces that %n isn't
used in dynamic format strings, but we should just disable its use on
darwin in general.
