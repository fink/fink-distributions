Description: GNU binutils for ATMEL AVR micro controllers
DescPort: <<
Removed libiberty.a installation of avr-gcc & avr-binutils.
Avoided using /sw/avr. Its lib & include folders have been moved to /sw/share/avr and the binaries are put into /sw/bin.
Removed xxx.info files to avoid clashes with other potential toolchains.

Patch for ATtiny4, 5, 9, 10, 20, 40 from
https://github.com/arduino/toolchain-avr/blob/master/binutils-patches/52-binutils-2.20.1-avrtiny10.patch

Further patches by Barney Stratford (barney_stratford@fastmail.fm):
- The most significant of the bugs was that the sts and lds instructions come in a shortened 16-bit form on the ATtiny40, 
so I've added them in along with the new reloc that the linker needs.
- I've fixed a bug that was present in the original unmodified  binutils that meant you couldn't use any symbol beginning
with 'r' or 'R' to refer to a register.
- I've added the ability to refer to XL, XH, YL, YH, ZL and ZH by name in addition to their numbers r26 - r31.
- For the addiw and movw instructions, I've added the ability to refer to registers X, Y and Z.
- I've added linker relocs so that you can use external symbols in the in, out, sbic, sbis, sbi and cbi instructions.
