Description: Manager for library compile/link flags
DescDetail: <<
This is a rewrite of the old pkg-config program, in pure C rather than
using glib.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The user-facing script is 'pkgconf' (in the 'pkgconf' package). As
this is a rewrite of the original 'pkg-config' program (in the
'pkgconfig') package with is own versioning, it is here at this new
name. We also supply a package with the old name that is just a
symlink for the runtime binary and to aid in transition. This new
suite has a higher version than the old package, so updating should
work cleanly.

The algorithm appears to be a strict "first match" search scheme to
find .pc files. The default search-path list is hardcoded into the
pkg-config binary at compile-time using data from the
'pkgconfig-common' package.  See the pkgconf manpage for env vars that
can alter the default.  A dependency on 'pkgconf' (at the version
where things work for you) is the only BuildDepends needed in packages
that use others' .pc files.

Lists of -I and -L flags are re-sorted to place all fink paths before
any system (/usr or X11) paths; other paths come first, so
PKG_CONFIG_PATH should allow users to over-ride fink, but fink always
over-rides system-supplied paths). This operation is controlled by a
wrapper script supplied by the 'pkgconfig-common' package.
