DescDetail: <<
When packaging KDE4 software, in your CompileScript, first do:

  KDE4_TYPE=x11
  KDE4_PREFIX=%%p
  . %%p/sbin/kd4.12-buildenv.sh

Then, you run cmake like so:

  mkdir build
  pushd build
    cmake $KDE4_CMAKE_ARGS ..
  popd

For legacy packages, the kde4-buildenv.sh script can be used instead.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
pkg versioning system:
%v = First version of KDE4 that this package was designed for
When the packaging needs to be changed, %r is bumped as normal.
If features for a new KDE are needed, then bump %v to match.  Keep all the existing buildenv scripts for legacy packages.

tarball naming and versioning:
Uses %v as usual to match what the info file declares.
Also uses a token after %v that very loosely tracks %r from the .info. If the tarball needs to be changed (e.g., to improve X11 detection) but without changing the script output, then bump that token to be "current %r"+1. Then, update Source: and Revision: in the .info.

Never use the literal string '%r' in the Source: field.
