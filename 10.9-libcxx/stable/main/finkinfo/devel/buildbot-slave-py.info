DescDetail: <<
Buildbot is an open-source framework for automating software build, 
test, and release processes.

For the corresponding master version of Buildbot, you may want to use Fink's
virtualenv to install with easy_install or pip, as explained in the tutorial:

http://docs.buildbot.net/current/tutorial/firstrun.html
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The buildbot master-side package has dependencies on non-current versions of
packages that are no longer available in Fink. The instructions in the tutorial
are a recommended alternative until the dependencies are updated.
