   # Need to get correct 3.x and correct vendor (i.e., full path).
   # Silly for 2.x, but on a codepath only used by 3.x so it's easier
   # than special-case patching different variants.

DescDetail: <<
As of pylint 1.0, this module is deprecated.  Use astroid-py.

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
Python source code for projects such as pyreverse or pylint.

It extends classes defined in the compiler.ast module with some
additional methods and attributes. Instance attributes are added by a
builder object, which can either generate extended ast (let's call them
astng ;) by visiting an existant ast tree or by inspecting living
object. Methods are added by monkey patching ast classes.
