# patch to correctly treat dimension declarations. send upstream.
# '&' represent the existing string, '$' is the separator
# '\' is the esc character and therefore needs to be escaped in the 
# replacemant string. i.e. '\\' gives '\' in the result.

DescDetail: <<
  The FCAT tool is used for the Coverage Analysis of FORTRAN codes.
  This includes

   - finding out "cold-spot" in Fortran codes 
     (the part of the codes that are never executed),
     and flags these parts line-by-line.
      

   - finding out "hot-spot" in Fortran codes 
     (the part of the codes that are most frequently executed),
     and gives a line by line profile.

  It is designed to working mainly with F90/F95, even through it can
  also work with fixed formatted FORTRAN, thus F77.
