DescDetail: <<
Flex is a tool for generating programs that require pattern-matching
on text. It is usually used together with yacc/bison to automatically
generate a parser for a language grammar, e.g. the syntax of a
configuration file.

This is a version of Flex that generates better C++ code than the
legacy 2.5.4 Flex.
The older flex-legacy package is stored in %p/opt/flex-legacy for
programs that need the older version.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Splitoff as separate package from flex at v2.6.4-2.
Includes only examples and generated PDF.
