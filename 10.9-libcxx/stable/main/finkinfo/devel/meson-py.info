Description: Cross-platform build system
DescDetail: <<
Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast,
and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible. 

The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer
spends writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted.
So is every second spent waiting for the build system to actually
start compiling code.
