Description: Legacy fast lexical analyser generator
DescDetail: <<
Flex is a tool for generating programs that require pattern-matching
on text. It is usually used together with yacc/bison to automatically
generate a parser for a language grammar, e.g. the syntax of a
configuration file.
<<
DescUsage: <<
One typically needs this package for the 'flex' and 'flex++' executables,
which are installed as %p/opt/%n/bin.  To make sure these copies
are used, either patch the build to find %p/opt/%n/bin/[flex|flex++]
explicitly, or put %p/opt/%n/bin at the beginning of the PATH
before at the start of the build (e.g. in the CompileScript).

You might also need to set these flags to build against it:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I%p/opt/%n/include"
  export LDFLAGS="-L%p/opt/%n/lib"

To access this version's documentation, set MANPATH=%p/opt/%n/man
INFOPATH=%p/opt/%n/info or add the paths via the '-M' and '-d'
flags, respectively.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
The 'flex' package tracks the current stable release, but some older
packages require an older generator. This flex-legacy package
exists for these older cases.
