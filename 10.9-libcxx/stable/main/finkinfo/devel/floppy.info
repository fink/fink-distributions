DescDetail: <<
FLOPPY is a software tool that takes as input a file of FORTRAN
77 code and checks it according to various "coding conventions".
Floppy can "tidy" the source FORTRAN, producing a new file with
indented DO-loops, block IF-s, and so on. Floppy can be used to
generate HTML from the Fortran program. In this case, a new file
is written where each module and include file name in the source
Fortran is replaced by an HTML Anchor. The format of the source
is preserved when the document is browsed by an HTML browser.
FLOPPY can also be used to write a binary summary file which is
then used as input to the FLOW program.
