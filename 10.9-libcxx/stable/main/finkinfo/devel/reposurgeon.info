Description: Tool for editing version-control repositories
DescDetail: <<
reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata and
removing commits. It works with any version control system that can
export and import git fast-import streams, including git and hg and bzr.
It can also read Subversion dump files directly and can thus be used to
script production of very high-quality conversions from Subversion to
any supported DVCS.
