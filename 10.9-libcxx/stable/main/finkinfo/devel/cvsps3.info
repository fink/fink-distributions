Package: cvsps3
Version: 3.13
Revision: 1
Description: Collect changesets from CVS repositories
DescDetail: <<
This tool can be used either by humans to inspect changesets or as an
exporter from CVS to other version control systems - it can be told to
emit a fast-export stream to standard output.

Please note that cvsps >= 3.0 is not fully compatible with cvs 2.x.
It does work much better and can now output a git fast-import stream,
but it will break many things that use it, like git-cvsimport.

Therefore the binary has been renamed to 'cvsps3' to avoid conflicts.

This is the final upstream release of cvsps. It is considered useless for
any cvs repo that doesn't have a linear history. Please use
cvs-fast-export instead.
