Description: Manager for library compile/link flags
DescDetail: <<
pkg-config is a script to make putting together all the build
flags when compiling/linking a lot easier.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Version 0.20 adds support for *.private fields in .pc files. Older
versions ignore them and most fink packages that use pkg-config do not
need them. However, packages supplying .pc that have them should take
steps to ensure users who might need them don't accidentally use a
lower version of pkgconfig and thus get deficient flags.

Fink only adds support for the %p/share/pkgconfig directory in 0.20.
Packages supplying .pc there should take steps to ensure users don't
accidentally use a lower version of pkgconfig.

pkg-config uses a strict "first match" search scheme to find .pc
files. The default search-path list is hardcoded into the pkg-config
binary at compile-time using data from the 'pkgconfig-common' package.
See the pkg-config manpage for env vars that can alter the default.
A dependency on 'pkgconfig' (at the version where things work for you)
is the only BuildDepends needed in packages that use others' .pc
files.

As of 0.22-4, lists of -I and -L flags are re-sorted to place all
fink paths before any system (/usr or X11) paths; other paths come
first, so PKG_CONFIG_PATH should allow users to over-ride fink, but fink
always over-rides system-supplied paths). This operation is controlled
by a wrapper script supplied by the 'pkgconfig-common' package.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Originally packaged by Masanori Sekino (until 0.15.0).

	Using pykg-config instead of pkg-config at build-time to break
	dependency loop and avoid needing to hard-code *_{CFLAGS,LIBS}
	for dependencies. The compiled pkg-config program uses glib,
	so it's better to have it use fink's actual (patched, tested,
	etc.) one than embedding its own cloned code fragments from
	glib upstream.

	pykg-config 1.3.0-1 was broken at runtime on 10.7 and gave
	non-intuitive diagnostics. Fixed in 1.3.0-2, so BDep:>=1.3.0-2
	as easiest way to get clean user experience (even though 1.2.0
	would suffice as well).

DescPort: <<
	Made --list-all output alphabetical. See
