DescDetail: <<
This is the reference C implementation of Argon2, the password-hashing
function that won the Password Hashing Competition (PHC).

Argon2 is a password-hashing function that summarizes the state of the
art in the design of memory-hard functions and can be used to hash
passwords for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.

It has a simple design aimed at the highest memory filling rate and
effective use of multiple computing units, while still providing defense
against tradeoff attacks (by exploiting the cache and memory
organization of the recent processors).

DescPackaging: <<
OPTTEST=1 blocks machine specific optimization which blocks portability.
