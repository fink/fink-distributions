DescPackaging: <<
As of 5.30.0-7: now rolls a standalone rather than interpreted
executable, which doesn't require sbcl at runtime.  This stops the
proliferation of sbcl-*-maxima package names, and avoids the need for
rebuilds when the sbcl revision is changed.

Pkg in crypto because of preamble of COPYING _ even though
it states explicitly NOT to be part of the licence.

As of 5.15.0-3, build like the prior maxima-nox package:
Separate out the xmaxima package, built against the system's Tcl/Tk,
as a SplitOff.

Move mgnuplot into the xmaxima package as of version 5.21.x, since it uses the
wish as set from configure.

DescDetail: << 
Maxima is a symbolic computation program. It is full featured, including
symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational functions,
integration, Todd-coxeter, 2D and 3D plotting, an ODE solver, and bigfloats.
It contains a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.
Maxima is based on the original MACsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.
This package contains the command-line executables, demos, sources,
etc.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Enter "rmaxima" for a command line interface with line editing.  
The "maxima" executable doesn't have this capability now.
"xmaxima" has moved to its own packages.
X11 plotting in gnuplot can be turned on via flags sent to the plot commands.
