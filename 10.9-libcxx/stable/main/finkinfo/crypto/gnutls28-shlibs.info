Description: GNU TLS encryption library
DescDetail: <<
GnuTLS is a project that aims to develop a library which provides
a secure layer, over a reliable transport layer. Currently the GnuTLS
library implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS working group. 

  Quoting from RFC2246 - the TLS 1.0 protocol specification: 
  "The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet.
   The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that
   is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery."
<<
DescPort: <<
   GnuTLS now uses an internal opencdk, even if the independent lib and headers are installed.
   Version 3.0.8 had new libversions of the two main shlibs, but the same libversion of openssl
   lib as 2.12.x -- so all 3 shlibs are installed in a private dir to allow prior shlibs
   with the same libversion to exist according to policy.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
   With format string strictness, High Sierra also enforces that
   %n isn't used in dynamic format strings, but we should just
   disable its use on darwin in general

   dmacks: libunbound is autodetected but was not tracked as a
   dep. Most users probably didn't have it installed, so we disable
   libdane (the feature that is enabled by libunbound being detected)
   for consistent results. Alt would be to enable it and add deps.

	Does not seem compatible with nettle7 API.
