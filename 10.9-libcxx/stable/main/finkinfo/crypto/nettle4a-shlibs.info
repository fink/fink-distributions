Description: Low level cryptographic library
DescDetail: <<
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in
 more or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented
 languages (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or
 GNUPG, or even in kernel space.

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of
 cryptographic algorithms for higher-level applications by
 implementing a context-independent set of cryptographic
 algorithms. In that light, Nettle doesn't do any memory allocation or
 I/O, it simply provides the cryptographic algorithms for the
 application to use in any environment and in any way it needs.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Using man pages written by debian for nettle4-bin utilities
 
 Had to recover from shlibs policy problem when releasing nettle 2.5 as package nettle4 
 with over-specified install_name for nettle shlibs.
 
 Would like to delete .a files, but tests are hardcoded to them. Something
 to fix later.
