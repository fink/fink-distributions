Description: Compression utility
DescDetail: <<
This package is an open source version of the arj archiver. This version
has been created with the intent to preserve maximum compatibility and
retain the feature set of original ARJ archiver as provided by ARJ
Software, Inc.

ARJ is a legacy compression format that was in wide-spread use among DOS
and Windows users in the 1990s, and competed back then with the .zip
format of the pkzip tool.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* Recreate configure script (after fixing configure.in a bit)
  so that modern day operating systems are detected and supported
  correctly.
* Remove 'static' keyword from intergrity_identifier to prevent
  the compiler from optimizing the array away.
* Fix issues on 64bit systems by adapting a Debian patch.
* Rename 'strnlen' to 'strnlen_intern' to avoid clash with
  a system API call on Mac OS X 10.7
* Add UseMaxBuildJobs to avoid a race condition (various headers
  are generated dynamically using 'msgbind', but the build
  dependencies to not properly reflect this).
