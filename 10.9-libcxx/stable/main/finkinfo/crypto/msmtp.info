Description: "SMTP plugin" for Mutt; other MUAs
DescDetail: <<

msmtp is an SMTP client that can be used as an "SMTP plugin" 
for Mutt and probably other MUAs (mail user agents).
It forwards mails to an SMTP server (for example at a 
free mail provider) which does the delivery.
To use this program, create a configuration file 
with your mail account(s) and tell your
MUA to call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.

Features include:
SMTP AUTH methods PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM-MD5
(and DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM when compiled with GSASL support)

TLS encrypted connections
(including server certificate verification and the 
possibility to send a client certificate)

DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support

IPv6 support (on systems that support it)

support for multiple accounts

sendmail compatible exit codes (which most MUAs understand).

"msmtp" uses GNU TLS as the back-end;
"msmtp-ssl" uses OpenSSL as the back-end.
<<
DescPort: <<
Switched this to use variants, since there are two TLS providers and the User
should be able to choose which one he/she wants.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
dmacks--disabled attempted creation of infodocs dir file (not
appropriate in a packaging/staging-directory environment).
