Description:  Encryption/Decryption Library
DescDetail: <<
libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and modes
found in mcrypt. It is currently under development but it seems to work
pretty good. Unlike most encryption libraries libmcrypt does not have
everything (random number generators, hashes, hmac implementation, key
exchange, public key encryption etc.). Libmcrypt only implements an
interface to access block and stream encryption algorithms. It's purpose
was to assist in the development of mcrypt by providing a uniform
interface to access several different encryption algorithms, so that the
main program is independent of the encryption algorithms and the modes
used.

Included algorithms: cbc cfb ctr ecb ncfb nofb ofb stream threeway
cast-128 gost rijndael-128 safer-sk64 twofish arcfour cast-256 loki97
rijndael-192 saferplus wake blowfish-compat des rijndael-256 serpent
xtea blowfish enigma rc2 safer-sk128 tripledes

Block algorithms can be used in: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB (8-bit and
n-bit, where n is the size of the algorithm's block length).
<<
DescPackaging: <<

NOTE: 
Since 2.5.4, libmcrypt does not use dynamic loading for the modules by default.
All the algorithms and modes are now included in the library. That way you can 
statically link the library and be 100% thread safe, since dlopen is not always 
thread safe.

Configure algorithms [optional]

make check
Algorithm: panama... failed internally
Bug report submitted
Do not use this method, it will crash. All other test ok.
