Description: GNU Simple Authentication and Security Layer
DescDetail: <<
GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is
used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication
from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL contains a library (libgsasl), a command line utility (gsasl)
to access the library from the shell, and a manual. The library
includes support for the SASL framework (with authentication functions
and application data privacy and integrity functions) and at least
partial support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN,
SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.

The library is portable because it does not do network communication
by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling application. The
library is flexible with regards to the authorization infrastructure
used, as it utilizes callbacks into the application to decide whether
an user is authorized or not.

GNU SASL is written in pure ANSI C89 to be portable to embedded and
otherwise limited platforms. The entire library, with full support for
ANONYMOUS, EXTERNAL, PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM-MD5, and the front-end that
support client and server mode, and the IMAP and SMTP protocols, fits
in under 60kb on an Intel x86 platform, without any modifications to
the code.
