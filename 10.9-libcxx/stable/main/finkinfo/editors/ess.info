DescDetail: <<
Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) is an add-on package for emacs text editors
such as GNU Emacs and XEmacs. It is designed to support editing of scripts
and interaction with various statistical analysis programs such as R, S-Plus,
SAS, Stata and OpenBUGS/JAGS. Although all users of these statistical analysis
programs are welcome to apply ESS, advanced users or professionals who
regularly work with text-based statistical analysis scripts, with various
statistical languages/programs, or with different operating systems might
benefit from it the most.
The rationale for developing ESS is that most statistical analysis systems
provide a more or less sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI).
However, their full power is only available using their scripting language.
Furthermore, complex statistical analysis projects require a high degree of
automation and documentation which can only be handled by creating statistical
analysis scripts. Unfortunately, many statistics packages provide only weak
text editor functionality and show major differences between them. Without a
unified text editor user interface additional effort is required from the user
to cope with limited functionality and with text editor differences.

To use ESS within Emacs, add this line to your ~/.emacs file:
(require 'ess-site)

If the site file is not found, it may be necessary to first add the site-lisp
directory of your Emacs version %e (likely 25, 24 or 23) to your load path:
(add-to-list 'load-path "/sw/share/emacs%e/site-lisp/")

DescPort: <<
Not running full test suite as 2 tests in run-tests --rstats are failing.
Hacked packages/install/ and -/remove/ files for byte-compiling .elc files
on installation from ./debian subdir.
