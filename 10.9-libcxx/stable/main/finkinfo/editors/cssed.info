Description: CSS editor
DescDetail: <<
	CSSED is a small editor that tries to ease the CSS editing.
	It features autocompletion, CSS syntax validation, selector
	wizard for complex rules, color wizard, box wizard, and
	other useful features to help web developers to create and 
	maintain CSS style sheets.
	It has also dialogs and toolbar icons for most used css 
	tags, css2 reference browser fully clickable to easy 
	integration in style sheet, as well as selector scanning 
	to quick change of property value, quick access via 
	temporary bookmarks, and digest view.
	Color syntax highlighting for various file types, program
	output, temporary and permanent scratch-pads completes the
	software.
	There are also some extras on the web site, especially the
	emacs launcher (others do not work at the time being),
	which allows cssed to be launched from emacs/xemacs.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	See the man(1) page for more information.
	You can customize the cssed-def.xml CSS definition file 
	by copying it from %p/share/cssed/data to your home directory.
	For more information, see the homepage.
	There are also add-ons as separate packages for terminal, 
	file browser, search within and outside of cssed, and tags 
	editing.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Dirty hack for Intel to find the right architecture

	CssedFileType is used in various other public headers but not
	declared. The members don't seem to be public (*-plugins don't
	complain) but need to declare the struct itself for document.h
	(same place CssedFileTypeID is used).
	
	LexCaml.cxx: fix incompatible type assignment.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Formerly maintained by Michele Garoche

	Create a dev SplitOff to comply with policy though the package
	installs only a binary, some headers and a pc file. 
	Patch the pc file and the main Makefile so that the headers
	get installed in the right directory.

	Includes own versions of libcroco and scintilla. Could use
	external deps? libcroco is locally hacked. See:
	http://mail.gnome.org/archives/libcroco-list/2005-August/msg00010.html
	Would also likely mean cssed would not need special tricks to
	get c++ linking.
