	DescUsage: <<
Other packages may need to pass explicit -lintl when linking. glib2
used to publish this flag via .pc and .la, so others' sloppiness
previously had no visible effect. As of 2.22.4-2, the default
glib-2.0.pc does still contain that flag whereas the one in
%p/lib/glib-2.0/pkgconfig-strict does not. Packages should test with
that path in their PKG_CONFIG_PATH and add explicit flag-passing if it
fails in order to prepare for the future when the default .pc may not
have that flag.

Description: Handy library of utility functions
DescPort: <<
	glib2 provides etc/glib-2.0/charset.alias for darwin because there's
	no system-wide charset.alias.
	See also: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346816
	Can we figure out how to generate this (gettext-tools config.charset
	for host=darwin5?)or import it from an authoritative upstream source
	instead of dragging along a legacy file in %N.patch?

	check uses some C++ but it doesn't leak out into the installed
	package

	Patch child-test.c for our location of `true`. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=495690

	We need to set LANG=C when doing 'make check', else a previously
	installed glib2 will trigger a crash caused by a bug in the old
	de.po. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310731
	Need to figure out how to patch tests/Makefile to use the nascent
	gettext dictionaries in preference to installed ones.

	poll() is broken on 10.4 but not 10.3; force internal emulation
	to regardless of config result so that lib builds the same everywhere
	and is portable.

	Need to patch gutils.h for inline semantics of gcc on OS X >= 10.5.
	gcc version is not sufficient to determine it (appears to be xcode-
	specific patches to gcc), so test Apple gcc build number. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=315437 (patch	#96366 does
	not work...not __GNUC_PREREQ). No idea a portable solution, but
	msachs says "static inline" is right for this case, so hardcode it.
	2.14.5 does it "differently" but still looks like the same wrong
	patch, so leaving our existing "static inline" hard-coding patch.

	Fix paths in glib-gettextize. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=518309

	Fix glib/gslice.c clobbering of errno.
	See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554092
	(patch from comments #14)

	Safer -framework flag to avoid future munging in .la. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566994
	Flag is not passed at all via .la now, but okay because we
	don't have static libs and the shared libs get what they need
	via dyld.

	Not fixing RTLD_GLOBAL configure test. See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=583010

	libgio needs libresolv to get _res_9_* symbols. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606857

	Hidden-visibility is only partially supported on non-ELF and
	causes problems on 10.7 due to use of weak aliases. Removed in
	future glib upstream, so scrap it here too. See:
	http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.gnome/2592

	String sorting ("collation") is broken on x86_64. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=612019
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673047
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Library contains some C symbols whose real name looks like C++
	munges. This should not be construed to mean that glib2 is C++ nor
	that it needs to obey Fink C++ packaging rules. C++ is also
	used in some self-tests.

	Prior to 2.12.0-1, %N contained the gettext catalogs and the
	charset.alias file, which are used by the %N-shlibs files. Starting
	in 2.12.0-1, they are all now in the %N-shlibs package, and %N is a
	dummy for compatibility and upgrades.
	More recently, %N was nuked entirely.

	Builds with included pcre instead of external lib to avoid need to
	cascade deps on pcre packages

	gtester-report claims to require python >= 2.4, but it appears
	to run with 2.3. Adjust to allow that version so can use
	Apple's on OS X < 10.5 also (py2.5 comes with OS X 10.5). See:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=553716

	The following are newly deprecated in glib2 2.18.1 since 2.14.6:
		g_assert_warning
		G_GNUC_FUNCTION
		G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION
	And in 2.20:
		g_volume_monitor_adopt_orphan_mount
	And in 2.22:
		g_drive_eject
		g_drive_eject_finish
		g_file_unmount_mountable
		g_file_unmount_mountable_finish
		g_file_eject_mountable
		g_file_eject_mountable_finish
		g_mount_unmount
		g_mount_unmount_finish
		g_volume_eject
		g_volume_eject_finish
	External packages and out-of-sync gnome core might still be
	using them, so may as well leave them undeprecated until jump
	to glib3.

	Leaving G_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES undefined in most places,
	though in the future it will become defined...

	Disable the FAM plugin for gio. Darwin doesn't have libfam.
	Fink has gamin, a third-party implementation available in
	fink, has a dependency on glib. Eventually package gio-fam
	separately to avoid circular dependency. But even if compiled
	and installed, gio-directory-monitoring doesn't work (does not
	detect dir creation/renaming/deletion or contained-file
	creation/deletion) so better to leave it out--gives runtime
	"Unable to find default local directory monitor type"
	diagnostic rather than silent non-workingness. Really should
	get a native file/directory monitor implementation, maybe
	using kqueue or FSEvents. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=543148

	libgio sometimes runs %p/bin/update-desktop-database from the
	desktop-file-utils package or %p/bin/update-mime-database from
	the shared-mime-info package, but those programs link against
	libglib. Leave it as %N-shlibs:Recommends:... to break the
	circular dependency. Ick. Required for self-test, so would
	need to build (but not test) glib2, then build d-f-u & s-m-i
	against it, then rebuild glib2 with testing enabled. Ick^2.

	Make sure the update-*-database programs can be found even if
	run from a non-fink'ed shell: explicit path and fink XDG vars.

	Don't install gdb files. They aren't named correctly and it's
	not clear they are usable on darwin. See:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606877
	Also, they don't even get installed in the correct location.
	See: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606872

	All libs are shared-only and all symbols are resolved via dyld
	so do not export dependencies' -l flags in via pkg-config.
	Reduces BuildDepends inheritance of things that are not in
	public interface.

	Upstream doc upgrade to gconvert.c for compatibility with
	newer gtk-doc.
	https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/commit/glib/gconvert.c?id=b5fb6b4bbfe5903be06a515449a07cf1f1119c26

	Using pkgconf instead of pkg-config at build-time to break
	dependency loop. The compiled pkg-config program uses glib, so
	it's better to have it use fink's actual (patched, tested,
	etc.) one than embedding its own cloned code fragments from
	glib upstream.
