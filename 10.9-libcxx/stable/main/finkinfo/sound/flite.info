DescDetail: <<
University of Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis Systems is a free
software multi-lingual speech synthesis workbench that runs on
multiple-platforms offering black box text to speech, as well as an open
architecture for research in speech synthesis. It designed as a component of
large speech technology systems.

Flite (festival-lite) is a small, fast run-time synthesis engine developed at
CMU and primarily designed for small embedded machines and/or large
servers. Flite is designed as an alternative synthesis engine to Festival for
voices built using the FestVox suite of voice building tools.

Warning: compilation can take a long time on machines with low memory.
