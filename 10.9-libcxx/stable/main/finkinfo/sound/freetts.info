DescDetail: <<
FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java
programming language.  It is based upon Flite: a small run-time speech
synthesis engine developed at Carnegie Mellon University.  Flite is
derived from the Festival Speech Synthesis System from the University
of Edinburgh and the FestVox project from Carnegie Mellon University.

This release of FreeTTS includes:

o Core speech synthesis engine
o Support for a number of voices:
  o an 8khz diphone, male, US English voice
  o a 16khz diphone, male US English voice
  o a 16khz limited domain, male US English voice
o Support for importing voices from FestVox (US English only)
o Support for MBROLA voices (downloaded separately):
  o a 16khz female, US English voice
  o two 16khz male US English voices
o Partial support for JSAPI 1.0
o Extensive API documentation
o Several demo applications
