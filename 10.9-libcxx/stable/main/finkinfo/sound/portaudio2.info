  PortAudio is a cross platform, open-source audio I/O library proposed by Ross
  Bencina to the music-dsp mailing list. It lets you write simple audio programs
  in 'C' that will compile and run on Windows, Macintosh, Unix, BeOS. PortAudio
  is intended to promote the exchange of audio synthesis software between
  developers on different platforms.

  The shlibs package contains the shared library only.

  It provides the v19 API and is build from the pa_stable_v19_20140103 release.

DescPort: <<
libtool not used, so links for shared library had to be created manually
and test applications taken out of bin/.libs/ libtool folder
copied doc files manually
Fixed syntax of link flags in portaudio-2.0.pc: "-framework X" -> "-Wl,-framework,X"

dmacks ripped out universal-build bits...it's not portable in fink

using tar snapshot as latest release is from 2011.
