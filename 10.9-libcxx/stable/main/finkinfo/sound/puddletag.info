Puddletag is an audio tag editor (primarily created) for GNU/Linux
similar to the Windows program, Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for GNU/Linux,
it uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to edit 
by hand are visible and easily editable. The usual tag editor features are 
supported like extracting tag information from filenames, renaming files 
based on their tags by using patterns and basic tag editing.
Then there are Functions, which can do things like replace text, trim it, 
do case conversions, etc. Actions can automate repetitive tasks. Doing web 
lookups using Amazon (including cover art), Discogs (does cover art too), 
FreeDB and MusicBrainz is also supported.  

Supported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.), 
VorbisComments (ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkeys Audio (.ape) 
and WavPack (wv).
