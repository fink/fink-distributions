Description: Extension module for the SQLite database
DescDetail: <<
pysqlite is a DB-API 2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite.

SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a
relatively small C library. It is a public domain project created by
D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the usual client-server paradigm, the SQLite
engine is not a standalone process with which the program
communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of
the program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard, including
transactions, triggers and most of complex queries.

pysqlite makes this powerful embedded SQL engine available to Python
programmers. It stays compatible with the Python database API
specification 2.0 as much as possible, but also exposes most of
SQLite's native API, so that it is for example possible to create
user-defined SQL functions and aggregates in Python.

If you need a relational database for your applications, or even small
tools or helper scripts, pysqlite is often a good fit. It's easy to
use, easy to deploy, and does not depend on any other Python libraries
or platform libraries, except SQLite. SQLite itself is ported to most
platforms you'd ever care about.
<<

DescUsage: <<
Trac will use pysqlite2 in preference to pysqlite.  If you install 
pysqlite2 after creating a pysqlite trac database, you will need to
update your trac database:

  $ mv trac.db trac2.db
  $ sqlite trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 trac.db

http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/PySqlite

Consider using sqlite3 from the main python25 package over pysqlite2
or use this just as a fallback:

try:
    import sqlite3
except:
    from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite3

<<
DescPort: <<
Until the sqlite3 build can handle the extensions, we must turn off
the HAVE_LOAD_EXTENSIONS.  This might come from disabling tcl.
