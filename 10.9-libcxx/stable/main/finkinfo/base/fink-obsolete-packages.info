This package is a base package for other ones that are considered "obsolete"
due to being superseded by a more modern package of a different name.
The designation of "obsolete" is signified by listing

  Depends:%n

in the obsolete package. Maintainers can thus use standard dependency
tracing techniques to locate and upgrade to more modern package-names
in their dependencies. The ability to remove this package without
breaking dependencies indicates one's fink installed package set does
not contain any obsolete packages. End-users can generally ignore this
package and consider it a part of the internal workings of fink itself.

This package is released under the terms of the GNU License (see the
COPYING file for details).
