Package: fortune-mod
Version: 2.12.0
Revision: 1
Epoch: 1
Description: Fortune cookies on demand
DescDetail: <<
 The fortune package displays epigrams selected randomly from a
 selection of fortune files. This is an enhanced version of the BSD
 program. The data files (which can be shared) are contained in the
 'fortunes-min', 'fortunes', and 'fortunes-off' packages.

 These are the machine-dependent parts of the fortune package,
 i.e. the fortune program and the programs used for generating the
 data files.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 To see a new fortune every time a Terminal window is opened, add the
 following line to ~/.login or ~/.bashrc:

 %p/bin/fortune
