DescDetail: <<
 You are in the presence of a System Administrator. Kneel.

 "On Usenet, we vent in a group called alt.sysadmin.recovery. The
 group has a FAQ. If you read the FAQ, you will find that you (the
 users) subscribe to this group at your own peril. If you want to
 be useful, why don't you run over to the supply cabinet and get a
 new box of pixels for the monitor.  As part of our venting, some
 of us have written a series of man pages that we'd like to see."

 Manpages you ever needed:

 bosskill c chastise ctluser guru knife lart luser normality nuke
 people pmsd slave sysadmin think whack

 A set of humorous manual pages developed on alt.sysadmin.recovery
 (don't treat them seriously!). They document a set of really useful
 tools that for some strange reason are not included in any
 implementation of Unix. This includes such famous commands as lart,
 sysadmin, luser, bosskill and others. The authors recommend these man
 pages should be installed on every system.
