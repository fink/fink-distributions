DescPackaging: <<
	Previous lynx maintainers:
	  Andreas "gecko" Gockel
	  Alexander Strange (through 2.8.4-24)
	  elcepi (through 2.8.7-2)

	The Makefile for the message catalogs doesn't respect DESTDIR,
	we work around that by setting the installation paths on the
	command line.

	Putting lynx.cfg in etc/ and the documentation elsewhere is a
	problem because the configure script uses libdir for both.
	Fortunately, only the path to lynx.cfg is hardcoded into the
	executable. So we set libdir to etc/ and override the doc and
	help directories in the install step. The Makefile edits
	lynx.cfg on the fly in the install step, so all paths are
	correct.

	Hard-codes executable paths as detected by ./configure. May as
	well use fink's commands that are from Essential packages...
	  gzip: gzip, gunzip, unzip
	  bzip2: bzip2
	  tar: tar
  	but then force others to be from OS X (avoid detection of
	coreutils and/or hard-code /usr/bin pathnames). gettext-tools
	is close enough to essential (or at least "always installed")
	no harm in Depends on it.

Description: Text-mode WWW Browser with NLS
DescDetail: <<
Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices.
It is very fast and easy to use. It will display HTML documents
containing links to files residing on the local system,
as well as files residing on remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP,
WAIS, and NNTP servers.
