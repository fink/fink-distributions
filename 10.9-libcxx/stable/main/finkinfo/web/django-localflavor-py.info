Description: Country-specific Django helpers

DescDetail: <<
From https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-localflavor :

Django's "localflavor" packages offer additional functionality for particular
countries or cultures. For example, these might include form fields for your
country's postal codes, phone number formats or government ID numbers.

This code used to live in Django proper - in django.contrib.localflavor - but
was separated into a standalone package in Django 1.5 to keep the framework's
core clean. If you are upgrading, you will need to change the imports:

  from django.contrib.localflavor... import ...

to:

  from localflavor... import ...
