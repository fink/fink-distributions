Description: Python web server
DescDetail: <<
Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web
server and tools that power FriendFeed. The FriendFeed application is
written using a web framework that looks a bit like web.py or Google's
webapp, but with additional tools and optimizations to take advantage
of the underlying non-blocking infrastructure.

The framework is distinct from most mainstream web server frameworks
(and certainly most Python frameworks) because it is non-blocking and
reasonably fast. Because it is non-blocking and uses epoll or kqueue,
it can handle thousands of simultaneous standing connections, which
means it is ideal for real-time web services. The web server is built
specifically to handle FriendFeed's real-time features--every active
user of FriendFeed maintains an open connection to the FriendFeed
servers.
