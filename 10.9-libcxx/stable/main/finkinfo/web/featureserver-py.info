DescPort: <<
Putting CGIs in %i/lib/cgi-bin to match apache2.

Avoiding ConfFiles for now to allow admins total control of the cgi
without surprises of the default cfg going in %p/etc/%n or similiar
location.

Description: Python RESTful Geographic Feature Service
DescDetail: <<
FeatureServer is an implementation of a RESTful Geographic Feature
Service.  Using standard HTTP methods, you can fetch a representation
of a feature or a collection of features, add new data to the service,
or delete data from the service. Use it as an aggregator -- post your
GeoRSS feeds to it, and then browse them using WFS. Use it as a
translator: use the OGR DataSource to load a shapefile and open it in
Google Earth.
<<

DescUsage: <<
You need to create a config file for featureserver and setup the cgi
before this works.  A sample config file: 

  %p/share/doc/%n/featureserver.cfg
