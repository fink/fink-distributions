  Atom syndication (comes with 0.3 format)
  templates and CSS style sheets for full control of appearance
  placeholders for easy template manipulation
  plugins for calendar, recent entries, weblog status, fortunes, etc.
  auto-formatting, e.g. line breaks translate to HTML
  support for relative and absolute links
  extensibility through parts (e.g. parts/2003-06.html)
  global configuration to set defaults (nb.conf)
  per-weblog configuration to override global defaults (blog.conf)
  intelligent build system, only rebuilds relative parts for a modified 
    entry
  simple cache system, for faster content generation
  auto-detection of weblog from current directory
  no dependency on any javascript, server-side scripting, or server-side
    includes
  no dependency on any special database (uses flat-file)

    required commands)
