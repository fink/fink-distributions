Description: Another httplib for python
DescDetail: <<
A comprehensive HTTP client library, httplib2.py supports many
features left out of other HTTP libraries.

HTTP and HTTPS
    HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was compiled
    with SSL support.

Keep-Alive
    Supports HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive, keeping the socket open and
    performing multiple requests over the same connection if possible.

Authentication
    The following types of HTTP Authentication are supported. These
    can be used over both HTTP and HTTPS.

        * Digest
        * Basic
        * WSSE
        * HMAC Digest
        * Google Account Authentication

Caching
    The module can optionally operate with a private cache that
    understands the Cache-Control: header and uses both the ETag and
    Last-Modified cache validators.

All Methods
    The module can handle any HTTP request method, not just GET and POST.

Redirects
    Automatically follows 3XX redirects on GETs.

Compression
    Handles both 'deflate' and 'gzip' types of compression.

Lost update support
    Automatically adds back ETags into PUT requests to resources we
    have already cached. This implements Section 3.2 of Detecting the
    Lost Update Problem Using Unreserved Checkout 

Unit Tested
    A large and growing set of unit tests.
