Package: cpio
Version: 2.15
Revision: 1
Description: Archiving program for files and tape
DescDetail: <<
	GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive, The archive
	can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.

	GNU cpio supports the following archive formats: binary, old ASCII, new
	ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1 tar. The
	tar format is provided for compatibility with the tar program. By
	default, cpio creates binary format archives, for compatibility with
	older cpio programs. When extracting from archives, cpio automatically
	recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and can read archives
	created on machines with a different byte-order.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	The utility is named "gcpio" to avoid conflicting with /usr/bin/cpio
	which takes different arguments.
