DescDetail: <<
KeePassXC is a modern, secure, and open-source password manager that
stores and manages your most sensitive information. You can run
KeePassXC on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. KeePassXC is for people
with extremely high demands of secure personal data management. It saves
many different types of information, such as usernames, passwords, URLs,
attachments, and notes in an offline, encrypted file that can be stored
in any location, including private and public cloud solutions. For easy
identification and management, user-defined titles and icons can be
specified for entries. In addition, entries are sorted in customizable
groups. An integrated search function allows you to use advanced
patterns to easily find any entry in your database. A customizable,
fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility allows you to create
passwords with any combination of characters or easy to remember
passphrases.
