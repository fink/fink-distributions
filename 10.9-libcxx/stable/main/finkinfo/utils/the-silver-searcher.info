Description: Code-searching tool like ack, but faster
DescDetail: <<
Installs a command "ag" (the chemical symbol for silver),
which allows you to search through code (and more generally, any kind of text)
similar to grep or ack, but much fast:
* It searches code about 3-5x faster than ack.
* It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
* If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search,
  just add their patterns to a .agignore file.
