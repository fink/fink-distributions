# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
libimobiledevice is a software library that talks the protocols to support
iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Apple TV devices.  Unlike other projects, it
does not depend on using any existing proprietary libraries and does not
require jailbreaking.  It allows other software to easily access the
device's filesystem, retrieve information about the device and it's
internals, backup/restore the device, manage SpringBoard icons, manage
installed applications, retrieve addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks
and synchronize music and video to the device.

See the README file for some commandline tools to access iDevices.
