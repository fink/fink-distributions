DescDetail: <<
Cleans up files in directories based on their age This package provides a
program that can be used to clean out temporary-file directories. It
recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir() across symlinks, and
removes files that haven't been accessed in a user-specified amount of
time. You can specify a set of files to protect from deletion with a shell
pattern. It will not remove files owned by the process EUID that have the `w'
bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like `rm -f'. `tmpreaper' will not
remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special files unless given a command line
option enabling it to. 

WARNING: Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'. There are no protections
against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment. The daily
tmpreaper run can be configured through /etc/tmpreaper.conf .
