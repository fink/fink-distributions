Description: Tool to rip DVD's from the command line
DescDetail: <<
Dvdbackup will extract all (or optionally only selected) titles as found on
the dvd. It will structure the extracted files in a format suitable for
burning at a later time with genisoimage and dvdrecord. Has the advantage
of being very easy to use, small, and fast.
