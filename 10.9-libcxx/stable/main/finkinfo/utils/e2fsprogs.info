# TheSin: fix pathnames for darwin
# dmacks: Self-consistent ordering of CPPFLAGS vs INCLUDES (external
#         -I in CPPFLAGS would mask headers in srcdir via INCLUDES)
# dmacks: avoid fink's libuuid, which wasn't being used correctly
#         anyway (OS X has it)

Description: Utilities for ext2/ext3/ext4 file system
DescDetail: <<
The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for hard
disks on Debian and other Linux systems.

This package contains programs for creating, checking, and maintaining
ext2/3/4-based file systems. It also includes the "badblocks" program, which
can be used to scan for bad blocks on a disk or other storage device.

	Description: Libraries for ext2/ext3/ext4 file system
	DescDetail: <<
The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for hard
disks on Debian and other Linux systems.

This package provides the ext2fs and e2p libraries, for userspace software that
directly accesses extended file systems. Programs that use libext2fs include
e2fsck, mke2fs, and tune2fs. Programs that use libe2p include dumpe2fs, chattr,
and lsattr.

libcomerr is an attempt to present a common error-handling mechanism to
manipulate the most common form of error code in a fashion that does not have
the problems identified with mechanisms commonly in use.

libss provides a simple command-line interface parser which will accept input
from the user, parse the command into an argv argument vector, and then
dispatch it to a handler function.

It was originally inspired by the Multics SubSystem library.

	DescDetail: <<
The blkid library which allows system programs like fsck and mount to quickly
and easily find block devices by filesystem UUID and LABEL. This allows system
administrators to avoid specifiying filesystems by hard-coded device names, but
via a logical naming system instead.
