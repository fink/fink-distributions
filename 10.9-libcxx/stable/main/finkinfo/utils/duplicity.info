# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted
tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote
or local file server. Because duplicity uses
librsync, the incremental archives are space
efficient and only record the parts of files that
have changed since the last backup. Because
duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these
archives, they will be safe from spying and/or
modification by the server.

The duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir
utility. Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync's
rdiff to directories---it can be used to produce
signatures and deltas of directories as well as
regular files. These signatures and deltas are in
GNU tar format.

DescPackaging:  <<
The testing phase needs more than the default 256
maximum files, it is set to 5120 in the test script.
Testing phase has 418 tests, 0 failures and 9
errors when built as nobody.  Upstream is working on
the testing issue.
