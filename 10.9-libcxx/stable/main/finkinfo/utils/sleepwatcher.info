DescUsage: <<
You can run 'sudo daemonic enable %N' as root to create a StartupItem for it.
If run as daemon all users can create two executable scripts ~/.wakeup and
~/.sleep, that will be executed when the computers wakes up or sleeps,
accordingly.

Can be modified to install a systemwide launchd config file to 
/Library/LaunchDaemons/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist
that looks for %p/etc/rc.wakeup and %p/etc/rc.wakeup on startup.

If you wish to give users individual control with launchd, follow 
the directions in %p/share/doc/%n/ReadMe.rtf.
<<

DescDetail: <<
SleepWatcher is a command line tool (daemon) for Mac OS X that monitors sleep,
wakeup and idleness of a Mac. It can be used to execute a Unix command when
the Mac or the display of the Mac goes to sleep mode or wakes up or after a
given time without user interaction. It also can send the Mac to sleep mode or
retrieve the time since last user activity.
<<

DescPort: <<
Initial port by Pepe Barbe <pepe.barbe@gmail.com>
nieder: Moved all chown commands outside of the Makefile and InstallScript to allow building as 'nobody'.

From version 2.1.2, can use launchd instead of the default daemonic.
