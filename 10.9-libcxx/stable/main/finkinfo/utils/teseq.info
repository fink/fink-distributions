Description: Tool for analyzing terminal control sequences
DescDetail: <<
	GNU Teseq is a tool for analyzing files that contain control characters
	and terminal control sequences. It is intended to be useful for
	diagnosing terminal emulators and programs that make heavy use of
	terminal features (such as those based on the Curses library). It is
	primarily targeted at individuals who possess a basic understanding of
	terminal control sequences, especially CSI sequences. However, by
	default Teseq will try to identify and describe the sequences that it
	encounters and the behavior they might produce in a terminal.
