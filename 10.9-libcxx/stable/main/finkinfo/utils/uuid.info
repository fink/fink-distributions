Description: Common API for unique numbers
DescDetail: <<
 OSSP uuid is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API) and
 corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of DCE 1.1 and
 ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). It supports
 DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node based), version 3 (name
 based) and version 4 (random number based).
 UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood of
 uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult to guess.
 They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally generated without
 contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs are intended as unique
 identifiers for both mass tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime and
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
