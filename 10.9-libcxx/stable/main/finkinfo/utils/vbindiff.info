DescDetail: <<
It can also display two files at once, and highlight the differences
between them. Unlike diff, it works well with large files (up to 4 GB).

VBinDiff was inspired by the Compare Files function of the ProSel
utilities by Glen Bredon, for the Apple II. 

The single-file mode was inspired by the LIST utility of 4DOS and friends.
While less provides a good line-oriented display, it has no equivalent
to LIST's hex display. (True, you can pipe the file through hexdump,
but that's incredibly inefficient on multi-gigabyte files.)
