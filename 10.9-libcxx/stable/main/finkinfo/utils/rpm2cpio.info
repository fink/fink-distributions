DescDetail: <<
The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven
package management system capable of installing, uninstalling,
verifying, querying, and updating computer software packages. Each
software package consists of an archive of files along with
information about the package like its version, a description, and the
like.

This package is just a shell-script implementation of the rpm2cpio
tool, which extracts .rpm archives.
