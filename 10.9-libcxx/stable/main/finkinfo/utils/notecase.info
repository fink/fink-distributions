Revision: 3
Description: Hierarchical note manager
DescDetail:  <<
NoteCase is a hierarchical note manager (aka. outliner). It helps you organize
your everyday text notes into a single document, with individual notes placed 
in the tree-like structure (each note can have its sub-notes, ...).
To ensure your privacy, encrypted document format is supported, along with 
standard unencrypted format.

DescPort: <<
Upstream apparently never actually used Fink, since they used dpkg, if installed, to 
check whether the build is on a PowerPC, but looked for "ppc-darwin" as the return 
value.  Unless, of course someone else is using dpkg....
Patch that test in %b/Makefile to look for the proper return value.

Upstream apparently thought that ".x11app" was a necessary or convenient extension
on OS X.  That was only true back in the days of OroborOSX, so patch that out in 
%b/Makefile.

Upstream thought OSX came with "gmd5sum", so patch that to "md5sum" in %b/Makefile 
so that coreutils isn't in the BDeps.

Ditch -bind_at_load, and add -dead_strip_dylibs to LDFLAGS in %b/Makefile

As of 1.9.3-4, hardcode in the X11 library location, since it was apparently using
indirect means to find them.
