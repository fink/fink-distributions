# Additional Info
DescDetail: <<
'usbmuxd' stands for "USB multiplexing daemon".  This daemon is in charge
of multiplexing connections over USB to an iPhone or iPod touch.  To users,
it means you can sync your music, contacts, photos, etc.  over USB. To
developers, it means you can connect to any listening localhost socket on
the device.  usbmuxd is not used for tethering data transfer, which uses a
dedicated USB interface as a virtual network device.

There is already a usbmuxd daemon running if iTunes is installed.  The
purpose of this package is mainly to offer libusbmuxd.dylib for other
programs to talk to the usbmuxd daemon.
