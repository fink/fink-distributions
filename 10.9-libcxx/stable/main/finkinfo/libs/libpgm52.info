Description: OpenPGM library
DescDetail: <<
	OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General
	Multicast (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org.
	PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast protocol that enables
	receivers to detect loss, request retransmission of lost data, or
	notify an application of unrecoverable loss. PGM is a
	receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible
	for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of reception
	responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram service,
	currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
	switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
