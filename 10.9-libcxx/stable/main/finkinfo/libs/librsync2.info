# Documentation.
DescDetail: <<
librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote file
synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility and is used in
rproxy. This algorithm transfers the differences between 2 files without
needing both files on the same system.

It was originaly developed as part of rproxy, but is now used by other
applications and has its own project on github.

This library was previously known as libhsync up to version 0.9.0.
