DescDetail: <<
    PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various
    archives. It is intended for use in video games, and the design
    was somewhat inspired by Quake 3's file subsystem. The programmer
    defines a "write directory" on the physical filesystem. No file
    writing done through the PhysicsFS API can leave that write
    directory, for security.  For example, an embedded scripting
    language cannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS
    for all of its I/O, which means that untrusted scripts can run
    more safely. Symbolic links can be disabled as well, for added
    safety. For file reading, the programmer lists directories and
    archives that form a "search path". Once the search path is
    defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem.
    This makes for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you
    access a file directly on the disk, and it makes it easy to
    ship a new archive that will override a previous archive on a
    per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you platform-abstracted
    means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the user's home
    directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running,
    etc.
