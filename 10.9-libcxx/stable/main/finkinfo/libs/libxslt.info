Description: XML stylesheet transformation library
DescDetail: <<
	This set of packages does *not* contain the python bindings. Those
	are in libxslt-pyXX for various pythonX.X versions.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	xsltproc moved from %N in 1.1.8-1 to %N-bin in 1.1.8-2 because pkgs
	need it at runtime but %N is the headers and is BuildDepensOnly:true
	so cannot be listed in a Depends. Added %N:Depends:%N-bin so that
	pkgs that depended on %N because they need xsltproc don't have to be
	changed.

	All crypto support in libexslt is disabled to avoid needing
	libgcrypt.
	See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=538358

	Avoid circular dependency with xsltproc: use system's at
	compile-time (for building included docs)

	Hide xsltproc executable from ./configure to avoid
	circular dependency and network access during build. Fortunately,
	this executable is only used to build docs that already come
	prebuilt (we patch the targets instead of patching sources and
	rebuilding). Update some target timestamps to prevent rebuilding.

	As of 1.1.29-1, scrap static lib, which means we can avoid
	publishing any internal-implementation flags. See also
	Debian's 0001-patch-xslt-config-to-add-private-libraries.patch
	         0002-fix-autoconf-automake.patch

	Avoid overly-verbose publishing of flags via .pc. See:
	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/issues/53

	Follow Debian's lead in assuming all linking is dynamic and
	remove --dynamic from *-config, but be lenient and don't have
	*-config crash when the flag is passed. But also don't pass
	that flag when calling that script outselves.
