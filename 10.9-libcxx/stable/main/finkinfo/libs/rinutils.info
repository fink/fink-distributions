DescDetail: <<
This is a set of C headers containing macros and static functions that are 
expected to work on Unix-like systems and MS Windows that have been extracted 
from Shlomi Fish's projects.

They are quite random and task specific and may not work for you.

Note: we only support the -std=gnu11 dialect as supported by GCC, clang and 
compatible compilers. Other compilers are not supported.
