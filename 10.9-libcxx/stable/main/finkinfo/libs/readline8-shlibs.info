Description: Comfortable terminal input library
DescDetail: <<
 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
 applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
 in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
 library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
 previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
 lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 * patch doc/Makefile.in to skip even trying to create texinfo dir file
 * add -MD to CFLAGS so that we can use fink-package-precedence
