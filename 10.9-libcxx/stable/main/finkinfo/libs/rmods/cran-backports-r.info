DescDetail: <<
Implementations of functions which have been introduced in R 
since version 3.0.0. The backports are conditionally exported 
which results in R resolving the function names to the version 
shipped with R (if available) and uses the implemented backports 
as fallback. This way package developers can make use of the new 
functions without worrying about the minimum required R version.
