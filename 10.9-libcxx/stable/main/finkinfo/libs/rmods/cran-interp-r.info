DescDetail: <<
Bivariate data interpolation on regular and irregular grids, either
linear or using splines are the main part of this package. It is
intended to provide FOSS replacement functions for the ACM licensed
akima::interp and tripack::tri.mesh functions. Linear interpolation is
implemented in interp::interp(..., method="linear"), this corresponds to
the call akima::interp(..., linear=TRUE) which is the default setting
and covers most of akima::interp use cases in depending packages. A
re-implementation of Akimas irregular grid spline interpolation
(akima::interp(..., linear=FALSE)) is now also available via
interp::interp(..., method="akima"). Estimators for partial derivatives
are now also available in interp::locpoly(), these are a prerequisite
for the spline interpolation. The basic part is a GPLed triangulation
algorithm (sweep hull algorithm by David Sinclair) providing the
starting point for the irregular grid interpolator. As side effect this
algorithm is also used to provide replacements for almost all functions
of the tripack package which also suffers from the same ACM license
restrictions. All functions are designed to be backward compatible with
their akima / tripack counterparts.
