DescDetail: <<
This package provide methods for calculating (usually) accurate numerical
first and second order derivatives. Accurate calculations are done using
Richardson's extrapolation or, when applicable, a complex step derivative
is available. A simple difference method is also provided. Simple difference
is (usually) less accurate but is much quicker than Richardson's extrapolation
and provides a useful cross-check. Methods are provided for real scalar and
vector valued functions.
