DescDetail: <<
Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing
procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling the family
-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail
probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false
discovery rate (FDR). Several choices of bootstrap-based null distribution
are implemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-transformed).
Single-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a variety
of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression parameters
from linear and survival models as well as those based on correlation
parameters) are included. When probing hypotheses with t-statistics, users
may also select a potentially faster null distribution which is multivariate
normal with mean zero and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector
influence function. Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values,
confidence regions and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly
applicable to identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray
experiments.
