DescDetail: <<
A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and experimental
psychology. Functions are primarily for scale construction using
factor analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although
others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is
done using factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations.
Functions for simulating particular item and test structures are
included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural
equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis
and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some
of the functions are written to support a book on psychometrics as well
as publications in personality research. For more information, see the
personality-project.org/r webpage.
