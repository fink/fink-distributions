DescDetail: <<
The tframe package provides a kernel of functions for programming
time series methods in a way that is relatively independently of
the representation of time. It also provides plotting, time
windowing, and some other utility functions which are specifically
intended for time series. See the Guide distributed as a vignette,
or ?tframe.Intro for more details. (User utilities other than the
programming kernel have been moved into package tfplot.)
