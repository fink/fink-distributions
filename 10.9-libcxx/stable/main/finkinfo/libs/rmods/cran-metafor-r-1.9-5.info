DescDetail: <<
The metafor package provides a comprehensive collection of functions
for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package includes functions to
calculate various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit fixed-, random-,
and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and meta-
regression analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical plots
(e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe, Baujat plots). For meta-analyses
of binomial and person-time data, the package also provides functions
that implement specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method,
Peto's method, and a variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects)
models (i.e., mixed-effects (conditional) logistic and Poisson regression
models). Finally, the package provides functionality for fitting meta-
nalytic multivariate/multilevel models that account for non-independent
sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due to the inclusion of
multiple treatment studies, multiple endpoints, or other forms of
clustering). Network meta-analyses and meta-analyses accounting for
known correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic relatedness)
can also be conducted.
