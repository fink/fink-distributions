DescDetail: <<
  A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to 
information contained in various R models, like model formulas, 
model terms, information about random effects, data that was 
used to fit the model or data from response variables. 'insight' 
mainly revolves around two types of functions: Functions that 
find (the names of) information, starting with 'find_', and 
functions that get the underlying data, starting with 'get_'. 
The package has a consistent syntax and works with many different 
model objects, where otherwise functions to access these
information are missing.
