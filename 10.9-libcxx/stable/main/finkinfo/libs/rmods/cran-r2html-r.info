DescDetail: <<
Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file.
Thus, making HTML reports is easy. Includes a function that
allows redirection on the fly, which appears to be very usefull
for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a copy of the
produced output to keep all that he did during the course.
Package comes with a vignette describing how to write HTML
reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for Sweave
allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to
automatically write the corresponding outputs (tables and graphs).
