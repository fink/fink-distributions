DescDetail: <<
scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally written as a Matlab-based
application. It provides a framework for simulation and optimization of
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models at the individual and population level.
It is built on top of the neldermead package, which provides the direct search
algorithm proposed by Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
