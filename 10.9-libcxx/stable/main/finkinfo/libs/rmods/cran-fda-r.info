DescDetail: <<
These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as
described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data
Analysis. New York: Springer. They were ported from earlier versions
in Matlab and S-PLUS. An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker,
Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and
Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files
working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this
latter book. Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no
longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.
For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/
There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample
analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation
and some additional information.
