DescDetail: <<
Rwave is a library of R functions which provide an environment for
the Time-Frequency analysis of 1-D signals (and especially for the
wavelet and Gabor transforms of noisy signals). It was originally
written for Splus by Rene Carmona, Bruno Torresani, and Wen L. 
wang, first at the University of California at Irvine and then
at Princeton University. Credit should also be given to Andrea
Wang whose functions on the dyadic wavelet transform are included.
Rwave is based on the book: "Practical Time-Frequency Analysis:
Gabor and Wavelet Transforms with an Implementation in S", by Rene
Carmona, Wen L. Hwang and Bruno Torresani, Academic Press, 1998.
