DescDetail: <<
PBS Modelling provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and
operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make
it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical user interface (GUI).
Although it depends heavily on the R interface to the Tcl/Tk package, a
user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The package contains examples that
illustrate models built with other R packages, including PBSmapping,
deSolve, PBSddesolve, and BRugs. It also serves as a convenient prototype
for building new R packages, along with instructions and batch files to
facilitate that process. The R directory '.../library/PBSmodelling/doc'
offers a complete user guide PBSmodelling-UG.pdf. To use this package
effectively, please consult the guide.

DescPackaging: <<
  R (>= 3.5.0)
  Doesn't compile against x11-dev or tcltk-dev headers, but does test tcltk/x11
  support during installation packaging phase.
