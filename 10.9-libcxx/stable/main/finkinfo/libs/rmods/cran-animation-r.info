DescDetail: <<
This package contains a variety of functions for animations in
statistics, covering areas such as probability theory,
mathematical statistics, multivariate statistics, nonparametric
statistics, sampling survey, linear models, time series,
computational statistics, data mining and machine learning.
These functions might be helpful in teaching statistics and
data analysis. Also provided in this package are several
approaches to save animations to various formats, e.g. Flash,
GIF, HTML pages, PDF and videos (saveSWF(), saveGIF(), saveHTML(),
saveLatex(), and saveVideo() respectively). PDF animations
can be inserted into Sweave/knitr easily.
