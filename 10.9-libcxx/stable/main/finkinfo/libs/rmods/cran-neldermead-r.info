DescDetail: <<
Provides several direct search optimization algorithms based on the simplex
method. The provided algorithms are direct search algorithms, i.e. algorithms
which do not use the derivative of the cost function. They are based on the
update of a simplex. The following algorithms are available: the fixed shape
simplex method of Spendley, Hext and Himsworth (unconstrained optimization
with a fixed shape simplex), the variable shape simplex method of Nelder and
Mead (unconstrained optimization with a variable shape simplex made), and
Box's complex method (constrained optimization with a variable shape simplex).
