DescDetail: <<
a collection of efficient, vectorized algorithms for the creation and
investigation of magic squares and hypercubes, including a variety of
functions for the manipulation and analysis of arbitrarily dimensioned
arrays. The package includes methods for creating normal magic squares
of any order greater than 2. The ultimate intention is for the package
to be a computerized embodiment all magic square knowledge, including
direct numerical verification of properties of magic squares (such as
recent results on the determinant of odd-ordered semimagic squares).
Some antimagic functionality is included. The package also serves as
a rebuttal to the often-heard comment "I thought R was just for
statistics".
