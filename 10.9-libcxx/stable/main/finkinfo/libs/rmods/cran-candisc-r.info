DescDetail: <<
This package includes functions for computing and visualizing
generalized canonical discriminant analyses and canonical
correlation analysis for a multivariate linear model.
Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted
to a one-way MANOVA design and is equivalent to canonical
correlation analysis between a set of quantitative response
variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor
variable. The candisc package generalizes this to multi-way
MANOVA designs for all factors in a multivariate linear model,
computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The
graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations
of terms in an mlm via the plot.candisc and heplot.candisc
methods. Related plots are now provided for canonical
correlation analysis when all predictors are quantitative.
