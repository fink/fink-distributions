DescDetail: <<
ROC graphs, sensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts, and
precision/recall plots are popular examples of trade-off
visualizations for specific pairs of performance measures. ROCR
is a flexible tool for creating cutoff-parameterized 2D
performance curves by freely combining two from over 25
performance measures (new performance measures can be added
using a standard interface). Curves from different cross-
alidation or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different
methods, and standard deviations, standard errors or box plots
can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. The
parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values
at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve
according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can
be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching
mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with
only three commands and reasonable default values for all
optional parameters.
