DescDetail: <<
bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs), coercion from and to logicals,
integers and integer subscripts; fast boolean operators and fast summary
statistics. With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,
TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means
factor 32 less RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due
to overhead of R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the
vector: expect gains for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-
time boolean operations it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is
obvious, when such components are used more than once. Reading from and
writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing standard logicals 
- mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package allows to
work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call()
directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated
vector memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the
time for copying from logical to logical; and copying from logical
to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the package now
contains further classes for representing logical selections:
'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges
of values for chunked processing. All three index classes can be used
for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).
