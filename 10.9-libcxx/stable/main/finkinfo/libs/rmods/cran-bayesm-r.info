DescDetail: <<
bayesm covers many important models used in marketing and micro-
econometrics applications. The package includes: Bayes Regression
(univariate or multivariate dep var), Bayes Seemingly Unrelated
Regression (SUR), Binary and Ordinal Probit, Multinomial Logit
(MNL) and Multinomial Probit (MNP), Multivariate Probit, Negative
Binomial (Poisson) Regression, Multivariate Mixtures of Normals
(including clustering), Dirichlet Process Prior Density Estimation
with normal base, Hierarchical Linear Models with normal prior and
covariates, Hierarchical Linear Models with a mixture of normals
prior and covariates, Hierarchical Multinomial Logits with a
mixture of normals prior and covariates, Hierarchical Multinomial
Logits with a Dirichlet Process prior and covariates, Hierarchical
Negative Binomial Regression Models, Bayesian analysis of choice-
ased conjoint data, Bayesian treatment of linear instrumental
variables models, and Analysis of Multivariate Ordinal survey
data with scale usage heterogeneity (as in Rossi et al, JASA (01)).
For further reference, consult our book, Bayesian Statistics and
Marketing by Rossi, Allenby and McCulloch.
