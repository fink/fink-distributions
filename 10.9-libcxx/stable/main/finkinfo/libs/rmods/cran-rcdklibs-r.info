DescDetail: <<
This package provides the CDK libraries for use in the R environment.
Given the size of the library itself, this package is not expected to
change very frequently. To make use of the CDK within R, it is suggested
that you use the rcdk package. Note that it is possible to directly
interact with the CDK using rJava. However rcdk exposes functionality
in a more idiomatic way
