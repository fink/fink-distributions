DescDetail: <<
This is an integrated meta-analysis package for conducting a research
synthesis with mean differences data. One of the unique	features of
this package is in its integration of user-friendly functions to
facilitate statistical analyses at each stage in a meta-analysis with
mean differences. It uses recommended procedures as described in The
Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, &
Valentine, 2009).
