DescDetail: <<
paran is an implementation of Horn's technique for numerically and
graphically evaluating the components or factors retained in a
principle components analysis (PCA) or common factor analysis (FA).
Horn's method contrasts eigenvalues produced through a PCA or FA
on a number of random data sets of uncorrelated variables with the
same number of variables and observations as the experimental or
observational data set to produce eigenvalues for components or
factors that are adjusted for the sample error-induced inflation.
Components with adjusted eigenvalues greater than one are retained.
paran may also be used to conduct parallel analysis following
Glorfeld's (1995) suggestions to reduce the likelihood of
over-retention.
