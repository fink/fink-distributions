DescDetail: <<
The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes and a set
of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists
in R. Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like objects
as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a few low-level concrete
subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame, Rle, and Hits) are implemented
in the S4Vectors package itself (many more are implemented in the IRanges
package and in other Bioconductor infrastructure packages).
