DescDetail: <<
We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis
of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel
peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment
(CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in
a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of
reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller
segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the
computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes
use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method
returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study
the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio
of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated
to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups
of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of
the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions.
Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the
null distribution from the experimental data. Related publication is
