	# The lib does not build with any SOVERSION and hacking to
	# include it interferes with inter-lib linking among the
	# components of this suite, so instead we bury the libs in a
	# SOVERSIONed subdir. The nspr.pc publishes -L to the subdir,
	# and we want to avoid polluting the main libdir with
	# accidentally-detected libs.

Description: Netscape Portable Runtime
DescDetail: <<
Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides a platform-neutral
API for system level and libc like functions.  The API is
used in the Mozilla client, many of Netscape/AOL/iPlanet's
and other software offerings.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Note: the dll handlers use ".dylib" not ".so" for the extension.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	dmacks overhauled 4.6.7-1 -> 4.8-1 all the following:

	Upstream does not update compatibility_version when added new
	public symbols! Maybe that's why debian hacked soname in
	recent versions? We'll do that too: rename nspr -> nspr.0d
	And then 4.8.4 -> 4.10.7 even broke ABI, so use nspr.0e
	4.29 adds a few symbols but does not appear to break ABI, so
	we keep .0e

	.0f seems to be the same as .0e, but we change our lib file
	burial scheme to avoid breaking the hand-coded makefiles,
	which means a different install_name.

	Bury library files so don't accidentally find them (many pkgs
	seem to need BuildConflicts:nspr)

	macos-target for consistency among all fink-supported
	platforms (cleaner to use %c than patch configure fallbacks).

	No external deps, so scrap -I and -L for %p altogether instead
	of tracing and fixing makefile-variable spaghetti that uses
	local -L for linking against build-dir dynamic libraries.

#	Don't leak internal-emulation poll() symbol into public of
#	libnspr ABI. It's not part of public API nor used by other
#	libs in nspr suite, and linker gets annoyed and confused when
#	other things link against libnspr because libSystem already
#	has that symbol.
#	^-- other OSX distros do not do this, so let's try not doing it
#	    either as of 4.29-1
