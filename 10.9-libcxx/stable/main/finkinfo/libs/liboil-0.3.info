DescDetail: <<
Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various CPUs.
These functions are generally loops implementing simple algorithms, such as
converting an array of N integers to floating-point numbers or multiplying
and summing an array of N numbers.  Such functions are candidates for
significant optimization using various techniques, especially by using
extended instructions provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).

Many multimedia applications and libraries already do similar things
internally.  The goal of this project is to consolidate some of the code
used by various multimedia projects, and also make optimizations easier to
use by a broader range of applications.

	Don't pass -I via CFLAGS (semantically incorrect--upstream has
	lots of this sort of error--and also (because it's a local
	path) appearing after global -I paths, which is functional
	mistake. Can't just switch LIBOIL_CFLAGS into INCLUDES or
	*_CPPFLAGS because there are lots of -f flags that might be
	for linker.

	Includes Debian's liboil-0.3.17-2 03_stride-segfaults.patch
