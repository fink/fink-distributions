DescDetail: <<
Orc is a just-in-time compiler implemented as a library and set of 
associated tools for compiling and executing simple programs that operate 
on arrays of data.  Orc is unlike other general-purpose JIT engines: the 
Orc bytecode and language is designed so that it can be readily converted 
into SIMD instructions.  This translates to interesting language features 
and limitations: Orc has built-in capability for SIMD-friendly operations 
such as shuffling, saturated addition and subtraction, but only works on 
arrays of data.  This makes Orc good for applications such as image 
processing, audio processing, array math, and signal analysis.
