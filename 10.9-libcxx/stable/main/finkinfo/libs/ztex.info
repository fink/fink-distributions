Description: Firmware development kit for FX2 USB boards
Homepage: https://www.ztex.de/
License: GPL3
DescDetail: <<
This SDK is especially designed for the ZTEX boards, but also works with other
EZ-USB FX2 based hardware. The SDK consists in a Firmware Development Kit for
EZ-USB FX2 devices and a Java API for the development of the host software.

A unique macro approach gives developers a maximum of flexibility in endpoint
setup just by calling a few macros and without the need of studying the USB
specification. These features distinguish the ZTEX SDK from the products of
competitors.

* Former maintainer: Sjors Gielen <fink@sjorsgielen.nl>

newer upstream claims to use new libusb, but only distributes a
pre-compiled libusb4java.dylib that apparently embeds it (no sources
for compiling and linking against our own)
