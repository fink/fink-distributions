Description: Modify system time for single applications

DescDetail: <<
libfaketime is a library that is dynamically linked to applications
or system commands at run-time by using the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
mechanism. It then intercepts various system calls, which programs
use to retrieve the current date and time. libfaketime can then
report faked dates and times to these programs. This means you can
modify the system time a program uses without having to change the
date and time system-wide.
<<

DescUsage: <<
libfaketime includes a simple wrapper called faketime. Run the
command faketime without any parameters for usage information.
For information on how to use libfaketime without the wrapper
and access its full raw functionality, please see
