DescDetail: <<
Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for 
maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression 
library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable 
compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, 
Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the 
resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On 
a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses 
at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable 
and MapReduce to our internal RPC systems. (Snappy has previously 
been referred to as "Zippy" in some presentations and the likes.)
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* Force c_v=5 to match the pre-cmake builds (ABI should still be the same).
	* Remove that patch once upstream bumps SONAME.
* Is lzo2 still needed, or is that used only in the tests?
* v1.1.9 fails to build with clang from xcode <= 11 (asm problem).
