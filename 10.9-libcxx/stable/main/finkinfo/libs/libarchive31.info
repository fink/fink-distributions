  DescUsage: <<
  You can usually use bsdtar and bsdcpio in the same way to GNU tar and cpio
  but there are some differences. Read bsdtar(1) and bsdcpio(1) manpage
  for details. The libarchive-formats(5) manpage describes the file formats
  supported by the libarchive.

<<
DescDetail: <<
The bsdtar program is FreeBSD's modern implementation of tar based
on the libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown into a
feature-competitive replacement for GNU tar.

The libarchive is a stream-oriented library for variety of archives.
It focuses on tar format and its variants primarily, but can also
read and/or write other families of archive formats.

Following formats are supported ('r' for reading and 'w' for writing).
On read, compression and format are always detected automatically.

[rw] uuencoded files
[rw] gzip compression
[rw] bzip2 compression
[rw] compress/LZW compression
[rw] lzma, lzip, and xz compression

[rw] GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and
     sparse files)
[r ] Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
[rw] Old V7 tar archives
[rw] POSIX ustar
[rw] POSIX pax interchange format
[rw] "restricted" pax format, which will create ustar archives except for
     entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, ACLs, etc).
     This is the default, which is mostly compatible with the standard tar.
[rw] POSIX octet-oriented cpio ("odc")
[rw] SVR4 ASCII cpio ("newc")
[rw] Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)
[ w] shar archives
[rw] ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge or Joliet extensions)
[rw] ZIP archives (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
[rw] GNU and BSD 'ar' archives (including 64-bit)
[rw] 'mtree' format
[rw] 7-Zip archives
[r ] Microsoft CAB format
[r ] LHA and LZH archives
[r ] RAR archives (including RAR 5.0)
[r ] ZIPX archives (with xz, lzma, ppmd8 and bzip2 compression)
[rw] XAR archives
[rw] WARC (ISO 28500:2009) archives

  detailed calling sequences for the read and write APIs
* archive_entry.3 details the "struct archive_entry" utility class
* libarchive-formats.5 documents the file formats supported by the library
  (in the bsdtar package)
* tar.5 and cpio.5 provides some detailed information about a variety
  of different "tar" and "cpio" formats (in the bsdtar package)

DescPort: <<
Since Darwin/MacOS X does not support any tape device, the default
device is changed to stdio. The manpage warns users not to rely on
this behaviour or they knock the real tape device on other platforms.

The share/man/man5/* manpages are previously included in the
libarchive package (for developers), but now in the bsdtar package.

Packagers should link the bsdtar utility against the latest version
of the libarchive and include it into the libarchiveNN.info.
When you create an incompatible version of the libarchive and bsdtar,
remove the bsdtar SplitOff from this .info and remove the %i/bin/ and
%i/share/man/man[15]/ directories.
