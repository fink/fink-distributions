	Description: Client-side interpreter
	DescDetail: <<
CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript
has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an
attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
.
The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
seamlessly (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and
pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will
work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run as fast or
faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
.
This package contains a concatenated and compressed version of the
CoffeeScript compiler. To use it in the browser, include the script
after any inline script tags of type "text/coffeescript" on the page.
It will compile and evaluate all of the scripts in order.

The "cake" executable is provided as "cake.coffeescript" to peacefully
coexist with cakephp.
