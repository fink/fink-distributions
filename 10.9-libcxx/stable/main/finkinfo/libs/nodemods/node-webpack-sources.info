Description: Source code handling classes for webpack
DescDetail: <<
This library contains multiple classes which represent a `Source`. A `Source`
can be asked for source code, size, source map and hash.
.
This library is a dependency for webpack. Webpack takes code targeted at
node.js and makes it run in the browser. Node.js comes with API of its own
that is not available in the browsers. Webpack exposes this code
to programs that are unaware they are running in a browser.
.
Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
