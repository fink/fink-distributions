DescDetail: <<
aspects.py is a lightweight and low-level library for intercepting function 
calls. 
Functions and methods (also in Python standard library and third party code) 
can be wrapped so that when they are called, the wrap is invoked first.
Depending on the wrap, the execution of the original function can be omitted,
or the function can be called arbitrarily many times. 
Wraps are able to modify the call arguments and the return values of wrapped 
functions and handle exceptions. There can be many wraps on the same function. 
The wraps can be enabled, disabled and removed in any order. 
In the terminology of aspect-oriented programming, the library allows applying 
advices (wraps) to call join points of methods and functions in around fashion.
