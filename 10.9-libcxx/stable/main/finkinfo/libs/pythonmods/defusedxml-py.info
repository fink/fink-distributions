Package: defusedxml-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 0.6.0
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8)
Description: XML bomb protection for Python stdlib modules
DescDetail: <<
	The defusedxml package contains several Python-only workarounds and
	fixes for denial of service and other vulnerabilities in Python's
	XML libraries. In order to benefit from the protection you just have
	to import and use the listed functions / classes from the right
	defusedxml module instead of the original module. Merely
	defusedxml.xmlrpc is implemented as monkey patch.
