Description: Python implementation of Ruby's XML Builder
DescDetail: <<
	xmlwitch is a reimplementation of Ruby's Builder library written and
	mantained by Jonas Galvez. It uses a very different technique (Python's
	context processors) but delivers an extremely similar syntax. xmlwitch
	leverages the with statement which makes it dependent on Python 2.5 and
	above.
<<
DescPort: Patch file makes us Python 3 compatible. Syntax error with py25.
