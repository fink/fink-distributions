Description: Easy allowed-list-based HTML-sanitizing tool
DescDetail: <<
Bleach is an allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips
markup and attributes. Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying filters
that Django's urlize filter cannot, and optionally setting rel attributes,
even on links already in the text.  
Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from untrusted sources. If you find
yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots
of things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users,
or don't.
Because it relies on html5lib, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at
dealing with weird, quirky HTML fragments. And any of Bleach's methods
will fix unbalanced or mis-nested tags.
