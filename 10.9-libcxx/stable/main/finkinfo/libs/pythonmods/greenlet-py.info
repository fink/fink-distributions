Package: greenlet-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 0.4.15
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8)

Description: Lightweight in-process concurrent programming
DescDetail: <<
The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython
that supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run
pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)
and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".

A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of
micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.
This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs. You
can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it
seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced
control flow structures. For example, we can recreate generators; the
difference with Python's own generators is that our generators can call
nested functions and the nested functions can yield values too.
Additionally, you don't need a "yield" keyword. See the example in
tests/test_generator.py.
