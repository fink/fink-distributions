DescPort: <<
0.99999999 and later are supposed to run pytest, but fail on collection as
the `pytest-expect` plugin is required. nosetests produce 3-9 Failures, + 13
Errors on 2.7.
Pypi page lists chardet-py and genshi-py as requirements, but there is no change
in the Test outcome with them installed.
