DescDetail: <<
The Trio project's goal is to produce a production-quality, permissively
licensed, async/await-native I/O library for Python. Like all async
libraries, its main purpose is to help you write programs that do
multiple things at the same time with parallelized I/O. A web spider
that wants to fetch lots of pages in parallel, a web server that needs
to juggle lots of downloads and websocket connections at the same time,
a process supervisor monitoring multiple subprocesses... that sort of
thing. Compared to other libraries, Trio attempts to distinguish itself
with an obsessive focus on usability and correctness. Concurrency is
complicated; we try to make it easy to get things right.
