Description: Python access to libusb
DescDetail: <<
PyUSB aims to provide easy USB access to the Python language.

Support for libusb 0.1, libusb 1.0 and OpenUSB.
Easy API to communicate with devices.
Support for custom library backends.
Isochronous transfer type support.
100% written in Python by ctypes.
Although the main API is not compatible with the 0.x version,
it is being implemented a compatibility layer to allow old
applications to get advantage of the new features of the 1.0 version.
You can find a draft of the programming tutorial about PyUSB 1.0 here.

Support for finding dylibs in %p/lib by ctypes of  Python[27,31,32] was
added by danielj on 20111230. I don't know how I can specify the
dependencies for py31 (>=3.1.4-3) and py32(>=3.2.2-2) -> py27 only for now.
