Description: Python parser supporting error recovery
DescDetail: <<
Parso is a Python parser that supports error recovery and round-trip parsing
for different Python versions (in multiple Python versions). Parso is also
able to list multiple syntax errors in your python file.
Parso has been battle-tested by jedi. It was pulled out of jedi to be useful
for other projects as well.
Parso consists of a small API to parse Python and analyse the syntax tree.
