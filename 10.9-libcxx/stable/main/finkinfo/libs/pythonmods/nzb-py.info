DescDetail: <<
NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP (Usenet)
servers.
Since NZB is XML-based, it's relatively easy to build one-off parsers to parse
NZB files.  This project is an attempt to consolidate those many one-off NZB
parsers into one simple interface.

This package includes three implementations: one based on expat, another
based on ElementTree, and a final implementation based on lxml.  The order in
which they were listed is in order of compatibility.  The expat version should
work on all versions of Python > 2.0, the lxml one will work on all
versions > 2.5, and lxml will only work if you have lxml installed.
