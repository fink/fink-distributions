DescDetail: <<
New usages of eventlet are now heavily discouraged! Please read the
following.

Eventlet was created almost 18 years ago, at a time where async features
were absent from the CPython stdlib. With time eventlet evolved and
CPython too, but since several years the maintenance activity of
eventlet decreased leading to a growing gap between eventlet and the
CPython implementation.

This gap is now too high and can lead you to unexpected side effects and
bugs in your applications.

Eventlet now follows a new maintenance policy. Only maintenance for
stability and bug fixing will be provided. No new features will be
accepted, except those related to the asyncio migration. Usages in new
projects are discouraged. Our goal is to plan the retirement of eventlet
and to give you ways to move away from eventlet.

If you are looking for a library to manage async network programming,
and if you do not yet use eventlet, then, we encourage you to use
asyncio, which is the official async library of the CPython stdlib.

If you already use eventlet, we hope to enable migration to asyncio for
some use cases; see Migrating off of Eventlet. Only new features related
to the migration solution will be accepted.

If you have questions concerning maintenance goals or concerning the
migration do not hesitate to open a new issue, we will be happy to
answer them.
