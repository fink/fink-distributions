DescDetail: <<
PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully 
integrated and thoroughly tested framework for: controlling third-party 
applications; devising workflows; querying databases; conducting novel 
probabilistic analyses of biological sequence evolution; and generating 
publication quality graphics. It is distinguished by many unique built-in 
capabilities (such as true codon alignment) and the frequent addition of 
entirely new methods for the analysis of genomic data.
