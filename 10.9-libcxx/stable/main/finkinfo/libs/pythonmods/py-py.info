InfoTest: <<
	# Needs to be run inside 'testing' subdir when package is already installed
	# to avoid conflicts with files in install location.
	# Tries to run path/{common,svntestbase}.py with tons of errors about missing
	# fixture 'path1', therefore running test_* files explicitly ("-k 'test_'"
	# does not help).

			perl -pi.bak -e 's|(py.test)( )|$1-%type_raw[python]$2|;' tox.ini
