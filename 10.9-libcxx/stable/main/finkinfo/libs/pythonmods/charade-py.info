Package: charade-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 1.0.3
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8)

Description: Universal encoding detector
DescDetail: <<
	This is a port of Mark Pilgrim's excellent chardet. Previous two
	versions needed to be maintained: one that supported python 2.x and
	one that supported python 3.x. With the minor amount of work placed
	into this port, charade now supports both in one codebase.

	The base for the work was Mark's last available copy of the chardet
	source for python 3000.
	
	This package is now obsolete and replaced by chardet-py%type_pkg[python]
	but packages need to be adapted to use it.
