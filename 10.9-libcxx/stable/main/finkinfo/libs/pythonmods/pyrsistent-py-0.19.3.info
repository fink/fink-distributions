DescDetail: <<
Pyrsistent is a number of persistent collections (by some referred to as
functional data structures). Persistent in the sense that they are
immutable.

All methods on a data structure that would normally mutate it instead
return a new copy of the structure containing the requested updates. The
original structure is left untouched.

This will simplify the reasoning about what a program does since no
hidden side effects ever can take place to these data structures. You
can rest assured that the object you hold a reference to will remain the
same throughout its lifetime and need not worry that somewhere five
stack levels below you in the darkest corner of your application someone
has decided to remove that element that you expected to be there.
