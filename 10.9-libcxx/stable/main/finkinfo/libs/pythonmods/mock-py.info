Description: Python mocking/patching library for testing

DescDetail: <<
mock provides a core Mock class that is intended to reduce the need to create a
host of trivial stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an action,
you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and
arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and set
specific attributes in the normal way.
