Version: 1.1.1
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8)

Description: Python file and path manipulation
DescDetail: <<
	The files module for Python provides an easy way to deal with files,
	directories, and paths in a Pythonic way. It was created out of a
	frustration with the standard Python approach to files and directories,
	the venerable os module.
	
	It is designed for Python 3.x but should work on 2.6 and later.
