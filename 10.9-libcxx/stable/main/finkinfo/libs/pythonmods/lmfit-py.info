Description: Least-Squares Minimization
DescDetail: <<
A library for least-squares minimization and data fitting in Python.  Built
on top of scipy.optimize, lmfit provides a Parameter object which can be
set as fixed or free, can have upper and/or lower bounds, or can be written
in terms of algebraic constraints of other Parameters.  The user writes a
function to be minimized as a function of these Parameters, and the
scipy.optimize methods are used to find the optimal values for the
Parameters.  The Levenberg-Marquardt (leastsq) is the default minimization
algorithm, and provides estimated standard errors and correlations between
varied Parameters.  Other minimization methods, including Nelder-Mead's
downhill simplex, Powell's method, BFGS, Sequential Least Squares, and
others are also supported.  Bounds and contraints can be placed on
Parameters for all of these methods.

In addition, methods for explicitly calculating confidence intervals are
provided for exploring minmization problems where the approximation of
estimating Parameter uncertainties from the covariance matrix is
questionable.
