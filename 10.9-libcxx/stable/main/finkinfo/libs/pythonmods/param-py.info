Description: Python library providing Parameters
DescDetail: <<
Param is a library providing Parameters: Python attributes extended to have
features such as type and range checking, dynamically generated values,
documentation strings, default values, etc., each of which is inherited
from parent classes if not specified in a subclass.
Param lets you program declaratively in Python, by just stating facts
about each of your parameters, and then using them throughout your code.
With Parameters, error checking will be automatic, which eliminates huge
amounts of boilerplate code that would otherwise be required to verify
or test user-supplied values.
Param-based programs tend to contain much less code than other Python
programs, instead just having easily readable and maintainable manifests
of Parameters for each object or function. This way your remaining code
can be much simpler and clearer, while users can also easily see how to
use it properly.

DescPort: <<
Package contains only 3 Python source files. Officially declared to support
Python 2.6-3.4, but works with 3.5 as well.
