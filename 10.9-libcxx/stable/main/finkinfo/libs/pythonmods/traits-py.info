Description: Explicitly typed attributes for Python
DescDetail: <<
    The Traits project is at the center of all Enthought Tool Suite development
    and has changed the mental model used at Enthought for programming in the
    already extremely efficient Python programming language. We encourage
    everyone to join us in enjoying the productivity gains from using such a
    powerful approach.

    The Traits project allows Python programmers to use a special kind of type
    definition called a trait, which gives object attributes some additional
    characteristics:
        * Initialization: A trait has a default value, which is automatically
          set as the initial value of an attribute before its first use in a
          program.
        * Validation: A trait attribute's type is explicitly declared. The
          type is evident in the code, and only values that meet a programmer-
          specified set of criteria (i.e., the trait definition) can be
          assigned to that attribute.
        * Delegation: The value of a trait attribute can be contained either
          in the defining object or in another object delegated to by the 
          trait.
        * Notification: Setting the value of a trait attribute can notify
          other parts of the program that the value has changed.
        * Visualization: User interfaces that allow a user to interactively
          modify the value of a trait attribute can be automatically
          constructed using the trait's definition. (This feature requires that
          a supported GUI toolkit be installed. If this feature is not used,
          the Traits project does not otherwise require GUI support.)

    A class can freely mix trait-based attributes with normal Python
    attributes, or can opt to allow the use of only a fixed or open set of
    trait attributes within the class. Trait attributes defined by a classs
    are automatically inherited by any subclass derived from the class.
