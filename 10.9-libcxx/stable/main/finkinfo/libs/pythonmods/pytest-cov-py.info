DescDetail: <<
This plugin produces coverage reports. Compared to just using coverage
run this plugin does some extras:

    * Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and
    will get covered without any fuss.
    * Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still
    get coverage.
    * Consistent pytest behavior. If you run coverage run -m pytest you
    will have slightly different sys.path (CWD will be in it, unlike
    when running pytest).

All features offered by the coverage package should work, either through
pytest-cov's command line options or through coverage's config file.
