Description: Config file reader and writer
DescDetail: <<
    ConfigObj is an ini file round tripper. Its main feature is that it is
    very easy to use, with a straightforward programmer's interface and a
    simple syntax for config files. It has lots of other features though:
        * Nested sections (subsections), to any level
        * List values
        * Multiple line values
        * String interpolation (substitution)
        * Integrated with a powerful validation system
            * including automatic type checking/conversion
            * repeated sections
            * and allowing default values
        * All comments in the file are preserved
        * The order of keys/sections is preserved
        * No external dependencies
        * Full Unicode support
        * A powerful unrepr mode for storing basic datatypes
