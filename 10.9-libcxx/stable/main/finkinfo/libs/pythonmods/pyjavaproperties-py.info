Version: 0.6
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7)

Description: Implementation of java.util.Properties
DescDetail: <<
 This module is designed to be a python equivalent to the
 java.util.Properties class. Currently, the basic input/output methods
 are supported, and there are plans to add the XML input/output
 methods found in J2SE 5.0.

 Fundamentally, this module is designed so that users can easily parse
 and manipulate Java Properties files - that's it. There's a fair
 number of us pythonistas who work in multi-language shops, and
 constantly writing your own parsing mechanism is just painful. Not to
 mention Java guys are notoriously unwilling to use anything which is
 cross-language for configuration, unless it's XML, which is a form of
 self-punishment. :)
