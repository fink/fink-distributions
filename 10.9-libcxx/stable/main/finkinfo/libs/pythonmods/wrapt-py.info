Package: wrapt-py%type_pkg[python]
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8)

Version: 1.10.11
Revision: 1
Description: Decorators, wrappers and monkey patching mod
DescDetail: <<
The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy
for Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of
function wrappers and decorator functions.

The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes
way beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure
that decorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking
abilities etc. The decorators that can be constructed using this
module will work in far more scenarios than typical decorators and
provide more predictable and consistent behaviour.

To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension
module is used for performance critical components. An automatic
fallback to a pure Python implementation is also provided where a
target system does not have a compiler to allow the C extension to be
compiled.
