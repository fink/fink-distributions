DescDetail: <<
Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
solving algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on
the seminal Cassowary paper. It is not a refactoring of the original C++
solver. Kiwi has been designed from the ground up to be lightweight and
fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500x faster than the original Cassowary
solver with typical use cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings
are consistently > 5x.

DescPort: <<
Post-1.1.0 versions are Python 3 only; officially only supporting 3.6+,
but 1.3.1 still builds and passes tests with 3.5.
