Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for Python
DescDetail: <<
PyStemmer provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a "stemmed"
form of a word. This is a form with most of the common morphological endings
removed; hopefully representing a common linguistic base form. This is most
useful in building search engines and information retrieval software; for
example, a search with stemming enabled should be able to find a document
containing "cycling" given the query "cycles".
PyStemmer provides algorithms for several (mainly european) languages, by
wrapping the libstemmer library from the Snowball project in a Python module.
It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for english:
although this has been superceded by an improved algorithm, the original
algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval researchers wishing to
reproduce results of earlier experiments.
