Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10)

Description: Python library for atomic file writes
DescDetail: <<
Atomic file writes.

	from atomicwrites import atomic_write
	with atomic_write('foo.txt', overwrite=True) as f:
		f.write('Hello world.')
		# "foo.txt" doesn't exist yet.

	# Now it does.

Features that distinguish it from other similar libraries:

Race-free assertion that the target file doesn't yet exist.
This can be controlled with the overwrite parameter.

Windows support, although not well-tested.

Simple high-level API that wraps a very flexible class-based API.

Consistent error handling across platforms.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Needs pytest to run tests and pytest >=3.6 needs invoke/atomicwrites; test script running
	depending on installation status of pytest-py%type_pkg[python].
