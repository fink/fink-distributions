Description: Enthought Tool Suite Application Tools
DescDetail: <<
    The AppTools project includes a set of packages that Enthought has found
    useful in creating a number of applications. They implement functionality
    that is commonly needed by many applications.
        * enthought.appscripting: Framework for scripting applications.
        * enthought.help: Implements the Adobe RoboHelp API in Python, for
          compiled HTML Help (.chm) and RoboHelp WebHelp formats. Includes an
          Envisage plug-in to provide context-sensitive help for applications.
          Can also be used in Traits-based, non-Envisage applications.
        * enthought.io: Provides an abstraction for files and folders in a
          file system.
        * enthought.naming: Manages naming contexts, supporting non-string
          data types and scoped preferences.
        * enthought.permissions: Supports limiting access to parts of an
          application unless the user is appropriately authorised (not full-
          blown security).
        * enthought.persistence: Supports pickling the state of a Python
          object to a dictionary, which can then be flexibly applied in
          restoring the state of the object.
        * enthought.preferences: Manages application preferences.
        * enthought.resource: Manages application resources such as images and
          sounds.
        * enthought.sweet_pickle: Handles class-level versioning, to support
          loading of saved data that exist over several generations of internal
          class structures.
        * enthought.template: Supports creating templatizable object
          hierarchies.
        * enthought.type_manager: Manages type extensions, including factories
          to generate adapters, and hooks for methods and functions.
        * enthought.undo: Supports undoing and scripting application commands.
