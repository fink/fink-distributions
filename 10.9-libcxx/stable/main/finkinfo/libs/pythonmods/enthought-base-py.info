Description: Core packages for the Enthought Tool Suite
DescDetail: << 
    The EnthoughtBase project includes a few core packages that are used by
    many other projects in the Enthought Tool Suite:
        * enthought.etsconfig: Supports configuring settings that need to be
          shared across multiple projects or programs on the same system. Most
          significant of these is the GUI toolkit to be used. You can also
          configure locations for writing application data and user data, and
          the name of the company responsible for the software (which is used
          in the application and user data paths on some systems).
        * enthought.logger: Provides convenience functions for creating
          logging handlers.
        * enthought.util: Provides miscellaneous utility functions.
