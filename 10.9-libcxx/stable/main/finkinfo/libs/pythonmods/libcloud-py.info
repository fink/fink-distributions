Description: Unified Python interface into the cloud
DescDetail: <<
 libcloud is a pure Python client library for interacting with many of the
 popular cloud server providers using a unified API. It was created to make it
 easy for developers to build products that work between any of the services
 that it supports.
 .
  * Avoid vendor lock-in
  * Use the same API to talk to many different providers
  * More than 30 supported providers total
  * Four main APIs: Compute, Storage, Load Balancers, DNS
  * Supports Python 2.5, Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3
 .
 Resource you can manage with Libcloud are divided in the following categories:
 .
  * Cloud Servers and Block Storage - services such as Amazon EC2 and
    Rackspace Cloud Servers (libcloud.compute.*)
  * Cloud Object Storage and CDN - services such as Amazon S3 and
    Rackspace CloudFiles (libcloud.storage.*)
  * Load Balancers as a Service, LBaaS (libcloud.loadbalancer.*)
  * DNS as a Service, DNSaaS (libcloud.dns.*)
 .
 libcloud was originally created by the folks over at Cloudkick, but has
 since grown into an independent free software project licensed under
 the Apache License (2.0). Fink considers the Apache license under the
 "BSD" umbrella.
