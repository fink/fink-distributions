Type: python (2.7)

Description: Fast replacement for decimal module
DescDetail: <<
	The cdecimal package is a fast drop-in replacement for the decimal
	module in Python's standard library. Both modules provide complete
	implementations of Mike Cowlishaw/IBM's General Decimal Arithmetic
	Specification.

	Both cdecimal and the underlying library - libmpdec - are extremely
	well tested. libmpdec is one of the few open source projects with 100%
	code coverage. cdecimal is rigorously tested against decimal.py.

	Typical performance gains are between 30x for I/O heavy benchmarks and
	80x for numerical programs. In a database benchmark, cdecimal exhibits
	a speedup of 12x over decimal.py.
