Description: Gibbs seawater properties
DescDetail: <<
This module is an python alternative to the gsw MatlabTM toolbox. The
table below shows some function names in the gibbs library.

Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater - 2010 (TEOS-10)

TEOS-10 is based on a Gibbs function formulation from which all
thermodynamic properties of seawater (density, enthalpy, entropy sound
speed, etc.) can be derived in a thermodynamically consistent
manner. TEOS-10 was adopted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission at its 25th Assembly in June 2009 to replace EOS-80 as the
official description of seawater and ice properties in marine science.
