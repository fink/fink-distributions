Package: mox-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 0.5.3
Revision: 2
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7)
Description: Mock objects for python based on EasyMock
DescDetail: <<
Mox will make mock objects for you, so you don't have to create your
own. It mocks the public/protected interfaces of Python objects. You
set up your mock objects expected behavior using a domain specific
language (DSL), which makes it easy to use, understand, and refactor!
