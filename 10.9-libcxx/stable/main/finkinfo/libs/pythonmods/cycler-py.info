Description: Composable cycles (kwarg iterator)

DescDetail: <<
When using matplotlib and plotting more than one line, it is common
to want to be able to cycle over one or more artist styles; but the
plotting logic can quickly become very involved.
To address this and allow easy cycling over arbitrary 'kwargs' the
`Cycler` class, a composable kwarg iterator, was developed.
