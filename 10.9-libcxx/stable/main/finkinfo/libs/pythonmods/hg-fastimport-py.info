Version: 20180204
Revision: 3
Type: python (2.7)
Description: Fastimport extension for mercurial
DescDetail: <<
	The "fast import" format originates with Git, where it is used as the
	generic backend for converting other SCM repositories to git. It's
	generic enough that it can be used to feed a Mercurial repository as
	well, and that's what this extension does: read a "fast import" stream
	and turn it into changesets in a Mercurial repository. The potential of
	this extension is that any foreign SCM that can be converted to Git can
	also be converted to Mercurial, regardless of the capabilities of
	Mercurial's own ConvertExtension. The catch is that the conversion is a
	little cumbersome: first convert to a fast-import dump, then feed that
	dump to Mercurial.
	
	Add 'hgfastimport=' to the [extensions] section of ~/.hgrc to enable.
