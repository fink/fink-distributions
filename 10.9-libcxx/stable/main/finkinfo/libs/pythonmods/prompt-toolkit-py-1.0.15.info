Description: Interactive command line building library

DescDetail: <<
prompt_toolkit is a library for building powerful interactive command lines
and terminal applications in Python.It can be a pure Python replacement for
GNU readline, but it can be much more than that.

Some features:
Syntax highlighting of the input while typing. (For instance, with a Pygments
lexer.)
Multi-line input editing.
Advanced code completion.
Selecting text for copy/paste. (Both Emacs and Vi style.)
Mouse support for cursor positioning and scrolling.
Auto suggestions. (Like fish shell.)
No global state.

Like readline:
Both Emacs and Vi key bindings.
Reverse and forward incremental search.
Works well with Unicode double width characters. (Chinese input.)

No assumptions about I/O are made. Every prompt_toolkit application should also
run in a telnet/ssh server or an asyncio process.
