Description: Vestigial utilities from IPython

DescDetail: <<
From the PyPI page: "Pretend this doesn't exist. Nobody should use it."!
It contains some common utilities shared by Jupyter and IPython projects
during The Big Split(TM).
As soon as possible, those packages will remove their dependency on this,
and this repo will go away.
No functionality should be added to this repository,
and no packages outside IPython/Jupyter should depend on it.

At this point traitlets and thus recent IPython versions don't work without...
