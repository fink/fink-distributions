Description: Python code coverage for testing
DescDetail: <<
Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test
execution. It uses the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided
in the Python standard library to determine which lines are
executable, and which have been executed.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
 Needs tox to run tests and tox needs pytest/coverage; test script running
 depending on installation status of tox-py%type_pkg[python].
