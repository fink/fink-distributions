Type: python (3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10)

Description: Cross-project testing tool for Python
DescDetail: <<
	py.test is a command line tool to collect, run and report about
	automated tests. It runs well on Linux, Windows and OSX and on many
	versions of Python. It is used in many projects, ranging from
	running 10 thousands of tests to a few inlined tests on a command line
	script. You can also generate a no-dependency
	py.test-equivalent standalone script that you can distribute along with
	your application.

DescPackaging: <<
	Needs tox to run tests and tox needs pytest. Unfortunately, tox tries
	to download and install packages during tests which violates fink policy.
<<

PatchScript: <<
	# Not hardcoding tox.ini to use the installed binary here - tox relies on using
	# the sandboxed copy (in %b/.tox/py%type_pkg[python]/bin) from this build.
	#perl -pi.bak -e 's|(pytest)( -[-nr][38adl])|%p/bin/${1}-%type_raw[python]${2}|g;' tox.ini
	#perl -pi -e 's|(sphinx-build)( -)|%p/bin/${1}%type_raw[python]${2}|g;' tox.ini
	#perl -pi -e 's|(coverage)( -r[eu])|%p/bin/${1}-%type_raw[python]${2}|g;' tox.ini

# I give up running tests. Requires net access to download multiple packages
