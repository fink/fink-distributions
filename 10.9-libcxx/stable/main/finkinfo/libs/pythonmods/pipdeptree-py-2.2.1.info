Description: Utility to show dependency trees of packages

DescDetail: <<
pipdeptree is a command line utility for displaying the installed python
packages in form of a dependency tree.  It works for packages installed
globally on a machine as well as in a virtualenv.  Since pip freeze shows
all dependencies as a flat list, finding out which are the top level
packages and which packages do they depend on requires some effort.  It can
also be tedious to resolve conflicting dependencies because pip doesn't yet
have true dependency resolution (more on this later).  This utility tries
to solve this problem.
<<

DescPort: <<
There are 2 python wrappers of graphviz, namely pygraphviz and graphviz.
graphviz is needed here.
