pyodbc is a Python module that allows you to use ODBC to connect to
almost any database from Windows, Linux, OS/X, and more.

It implements the Python Database API Specification v2.0, but
additional features have been added to simplify database programming
even more.

Installers for Windows are available here and most Linux distributions
are starting to provide pre-compiled packages. Full source code is
also available (see the link on the right).
