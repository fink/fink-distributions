Description: Python autocompletion tool for e.g. editors
DescDetail: <<
Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors.
Its historic focus is autocompletion, but it does static analysis for now as
well. Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper
level than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.
Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It is possible to search
for related names and to list all names in a Python file and infer them.
Jedi understands docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL
as well. Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDEs. There is a
reference implementation as a VIM-Plugin, which uses Jedi's autocompletion, on
https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim
We encourage you to use Jedi in your IDEs. It's really easy.
Jedi can currently be used with Vim, Emacs, Kate, Ipython 6+ and many more.
