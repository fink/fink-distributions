Description: Traits-capable windowing framework
DescDetail: <<
    The TraitsGUI project contains a toolkit-independent GUI abstraction layer
    (known as Pyface), which is used to support the "visualization" features
    of the Traits package. Thus, you can write code in terms of the Traits API
    (views, items, editors, etc.), and let TraitsGUI and your selected toolkit
    and back-end take care of the details of displaying them.
