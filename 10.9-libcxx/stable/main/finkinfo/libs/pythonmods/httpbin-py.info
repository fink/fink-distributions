DescDetail: <<
This is a fork of the original httpbin project, which is located at
https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin

Why fork? we were unable to get ahold of the folks at postmanlabs to
maintain the original project, and httpbin is used for other packages
within the python ecosystem, such as pytest-httpbin which is in turn
used by packages such as requests so we have forked this package. That
means that httpbin.org is not actually backed by this repo, but the
httpbin package is. Confusing right?
