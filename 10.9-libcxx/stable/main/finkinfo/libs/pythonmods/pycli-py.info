Description: Simple, OO approach to Python CLI apps
DescDetail: <<
	The cli package is a framework for making simple, correct command line
	applications in Python. With cli, you can quickly add standard command
	line parsing; logging; unit and functional testing; configuration file
	parsing; and profiling to your CLI apps. To make it easier to do the
	right thing, cli wraps all of these tools into a single, consistent
	application interface.
