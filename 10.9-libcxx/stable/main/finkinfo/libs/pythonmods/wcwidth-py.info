Description: Measure number of Terminal column cells

DescDetail: <<
This library measures the number of Terminal column cells of wide-character
codes. It is mainly intended for those implementing a Terminal Emulator,
or programs that carefully produce output to be interpreted by one.

Problem Statement: When printed to the screen, the length of the string is
usually equal to the number of cells it occupies. However, there are categories
of characters that occupy 2 cells (full-wide), and others that occupy 0.

Solution: POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 conforming systems provide wcwidth(3)
and wcswidth(3) C functions of which this python module's functions precisely
copy. These functions return the number of cells a unicode string is expected
to occupy.

This library aims to be forward-looking, portable, and most correct. The most
current release of this API is based on the Unicode Standard release files.
