Description: Python bindings for the wxGTK library
DescDetail: <<
    In addition to common and advanced GUI facilities such as
    frames, scrolling windows, toolbars, tree controls, icons,
    device contexts, printing, splitter windows and so on, there are
    wrappers for common file operations, and facilities for writing
    TCP/IP applications, thread handling, and more. Where certain
    features are not available on a platform, such as MDI and tree
    controls on Unix, they are emulated.
    
    This package provides a Python binding to the Cocoa framework and
    the wxPython runtime support libraries.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Keep the version of this in sync with that of wxwidgets300-osxcocoa.
A gtk2 variant is not available as upstream wxPython no longer supports
osx-gtk2 builds in configure and the underlying code is highly bit-rotted.
Disable check for Framework build of python in src/osx_cocoa/_core.py.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The demos can be run by executing the command...
'%p/share/doc/wxpython300-py%type_pkg[python]/demo/demo.py'.

To allow this package to co-exist with wxgtk2.8-py, the wx.pth file
is renamed to wx-3.0.pth. A symlink to it and the remaining ones in
%p/lib/python%type_raw[python]/site-packages/wx-3.0-osx_cocoa/
are buried in %p/lib/wxpython300-py%type_pkg[python]. Packages building
against wxpython300-py% should set...

  PYTHONPATH="%p/lib/wxpython300-py%type_pkg[python]"
