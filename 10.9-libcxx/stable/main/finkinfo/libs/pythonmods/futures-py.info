Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7)
Description: Backport of the concurrent.futures package
DescDetail: <<
	The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for
	asynchronously executing callables.

	The asynchronous execution can be be performed with threads, using
	ThreadPoolExecutor, or separate processes, using ProcessPoolExecutor.
	Both implement the same interface, which is defined by the abstract
	Executor class.
	
	This is a backport of the module included in python 3.2.
