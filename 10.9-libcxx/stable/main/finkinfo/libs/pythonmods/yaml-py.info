Description: Python YAML read/write
DescDetail: <<
YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages.

PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language.

PyYAML features

 * a complete YAML 1.1 parser. In particular, PyYAML can parse all
     examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple
     enough to be a reference for YAML parser implementors. 
 * Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output and \u escape
     sequences. 
 * low-level event-based parser and emitter API (like SAX).
 * high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Python
     objects (like DOM or pickle).
 * support for all types from the YAML types repository. A simple
     extension API is provided. 
 * both pure-Python and fast LibYAML-based parsers and emitters.
 * relatively sensible error messages.
