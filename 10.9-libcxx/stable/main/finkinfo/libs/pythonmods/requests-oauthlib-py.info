Description: OAuthlib authentication support for Requests

DescDetail: <<
    Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for
    human beings.

    This project provides first-class OAuth library support for Requests.

    OAuth 1 can seem overly complicated and it sure has its quirks.
    Luckily, requests_oauthlib hides most of these and let you focus
    at the task at hand.
