DescPackaging: <<
Common for all octave-forge packages:
Preinst and postinst scripts are dynamically set up via 
%p/share/fink-octave-scripts/octave-forge-patch.sh because Octave's package manager 
can't cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template.
