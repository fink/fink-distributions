# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: S-Lang programming library, version 2
DescDetail: <<
S-Lang is an interpreted language that was designed from the start to
be easily embedded into a program to provide it with a powerful
extension language.

S-Lang also provides a platform-independent interface for screen
management, keymaps and low-level terminal I/O.
<<
DescPort: <<
CPPFLAGS is ignored, so we use CFLAGS instead.

We use env tricks to make sure the include files and libs in the build dir
are used, not any already installed ones.

For the tests, we additionally set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the freshly
built shared libs are loaded, not any previously installed versions
in %p/lib.
