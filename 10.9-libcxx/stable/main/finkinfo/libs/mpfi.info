Description: Library for interval arithmetic
DescDetail: <<
MPFI is intended to be a portable library written in C for arbitrary
precision interval arithmetic with intervals represented using MPFR
reliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library and on
the MPFR library. The purpose of an arbitrary precision interval arithmetic
is on the one hand to get guaranteed results, thanks to interval
computation, and on the other hand to obtain accurate results, thanks to
multiple precision arithmetic. The MPFI library is built upon MPFR in order
to benefit from the correct roundings provided by MPFR. Further advantages
of using MPFR are its portability and compliance with the IEEE 754 standard
for floating-point arithmetic.
