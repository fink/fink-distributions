DescDetail: <<
Libmwaw is a new project for converting many pre-OSX MAC text formats and
some spreadsheet formats.
<<
DescUsage: <<
- mwaw2html: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) to html,
   keeping most of the character and paragraph properties and the
   tables, but not the pictures, ...
   
- mwaw2text: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) to text,
   keeping only the different characters
   
- mwaw2raw: a utility which outputs the list of instructions sent by
   libmwaw, can be used for debugging, ...
   
- mwaw2csv: convert the main AppleWorks database/spreadsheet content to csv

- mwawFile:
   a small tool which tries to find the type of a file first by
   looking to the finder information, then in the ressource fork for
   strings -16396, -16397 : application missing name or missing
   message and finally looking for a signature in the application
   datafork...

   Note: it first uses attributes to find finder information and
     resource data ; if it finds none, it looks for a file ._filename
     or __MACOSX/._filename ; if not, it looks for a file FINDER.DAT
     and a RESOURCE.FRK directory.

- mwawZip:
   a small tool which tries to zip a file and it attributes to obtain
   a file which can be used as input of mwaw2odt, mwaw2html, ... : an
   equivalent of the Finder compress function.

   More precisely, when zipping a file <<filename>>, it includes the
   file datafork and looks for attributes ( either using
   FINDER.DAT/RESOURCE.FRK or getxattr or in a file ._filename or
   __MACOSX/._filename ). If so, it includes them in the result file.

   Notes:
	- in order to avoid mistakes, it stops if the resulting zip
	file already exists.
	- only one file can be zipped, ... .
