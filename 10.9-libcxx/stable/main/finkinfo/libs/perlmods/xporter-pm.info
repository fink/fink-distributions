DescDetail: <<
Xporter provides EXPORT functionality similar to Exporter with some
different rules to simplify common cases.

The primary difference, in Xporter is that the default EXPORT list
remains the default EXPORT list unless the user specifically asks for it
to not be included, whereas in Exporter, asking for any additional
exports from the EXPORT_OK list, clears the default EXPORT list.
