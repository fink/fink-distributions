Description: Perl module to get stock quotes
DescPort: <<
yahoo has disabled their quote retrieval API. yahoo_json may still work, but
F::Q recently added compatibility with alphavantage. Alphavantage requires 
users to register for a free API key to access quotes from the alphavantage
servers.

See: https://www.alphavantage.co

Then include ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=<yourkeyhere> in your process or system
environment.

Finance-quote will always fail some of its tests. Some of the failures
depend on time-of-day when quotes are available. Upstream is not too
careful about housecleaning old submodules, either.
Tests require online access because without online access, the tests
make no sense, it being that the module retrieves quotes from online
sources.
<<
DescDetail: <<
Provides access to time-delayed stockquotes from a number of sources.  After 
you've installed the package, try 'perldoc Finance::Quote'. This version makes
use of https for several quote sources.
