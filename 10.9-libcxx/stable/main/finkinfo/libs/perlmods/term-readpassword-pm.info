Description: Terminal password prompt without echo
DescDetail: <<
This module lets you ask the user for a password in the traditional
way, from the keyboard, without echoing.

This is not intended for use over the web; user authentication over the
web is another matter entirely. Also, this module should generally be
used in conjunction with Perl's crypt() function, sold separately.
<<
DescPort: <<
Disable test because they involve user interaction (duh, that's what
the module is for).

Uses Term::ReadLine; a (minimal) version of that is a perl core module.
