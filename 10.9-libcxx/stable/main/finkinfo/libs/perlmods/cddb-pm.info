Description: High-level interface to cddb protocol servers
DescDetail: <<
This module provides a high-level Perl interface to cddbp servers.
With it, a Perl program can identify and possibly gather details about
a CD based on its "table of contents" (the disc's track times and offsets).

Disc details have been useful for generating CD catalogs, naming mp3 
files, printing CD liners, or even just playing discs in an automated 
jukebox
<<
DescUsage: <<
  If you want to submit track data, you must install Fink's
  mailtools-pmXXX, mime-tools-pmXXX, and libwww-pmXXX packages, where
  XXX corresponds to the version of perl you are using (5182 (for
  perl5.18.2) is most likely on OS X 10.13, for example).

  Installing encode-pmXXX will help with non-ASCII character handling
  (utf-8)
<<
DescPort: <<
  make test removed by Justin Hallett:
    it seems that the cddb site has changed and thus break the tests,
    this should be fixed in the next release
  dmacks concurs:
    don't want to require network connectivity in order to compile
