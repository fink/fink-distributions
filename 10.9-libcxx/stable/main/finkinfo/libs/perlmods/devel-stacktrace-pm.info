DescDetail: <<
Simple objects to deal with stack traces.  The parent object,
Devel::StackTrace, holds a number of Devel::StackTraceFrame objects
(which have the same information as is returned from caller()).  You
can step through these frames forwards and backwards as you want or
retrieve specific frames.
