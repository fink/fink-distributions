DescPackaging: <<
	As of mime-base64-pmXXX 3.06, some scripts were offloaded to a
	new upstream distro. We had them as a mime-base64-pmXXX-bin
	splitoff. Now that -bin is a separate .info (to allow it to
	fade away as an OBSOLETE bundle, only available up to -pm5182)
	and the scripts themselves are in mime-base64-scripts. Their
	dependencies are fully satisfiable by perlcore >= 5.7.3, so
	they can use system-perl and not need to be varianted.
