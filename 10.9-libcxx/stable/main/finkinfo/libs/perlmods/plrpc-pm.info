DescDetail: <<
	PlRPC (Perl RPC) is a package for implementing servers and clients that
	are written in Perl entirely. The name is borrowed from Sun's RPC
	(Remote Procedure Call), but it could as well be RMI like Java's "Remote
	Method Interface), because PlRPC gives you the complete power of Perl's
	OO framework in a very simple manner.

	RPC::PlServer is the package used on the server side, and you guess what
	RPC::PlClient is for. Both share the package RPC::PlServer::Comm for
	communication purposes. See PlRPC::Client(3) and RPC::PlServer::Comm for
	these parts.
