DescDetail: <<
A start for a more detailed data-structure to keep knowledge
about various data types are defined by MIME.  Some basic
treatments with mime types are implemented.

The first special data item is whether a data type is binary
or ascii.  This is required for correctly encoding e-mail
attachments, and implemented for the Mail::Box v2.01 module.
