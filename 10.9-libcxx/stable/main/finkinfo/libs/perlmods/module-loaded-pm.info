Description: Runtime marking of module load status
DescDetail: <<
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided
by external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark
these external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be
loaded by perl, this module offers you a very simple way to mark
modules as loaded and unloaded.
