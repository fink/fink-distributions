Description: Helps preserve order in associative arrays
DescDetail: <<
  If you have been led to believe that associative arrays in perl
  don't preserve order, and if you have ever craved for that feature,
  this module is for you.  Simply declare a "tie" for the hash variable
  that you want to be order-preserving, and forget that limitation
  ever existed.  You can do other nifty things with the tied hash object
  that you may be used to doing with arrays, like Push(), Pop() and
  Splice().

  If you don't know what "tie" means, you should look at the
  perltie(1) manpage in a recent perl distribution, or in the
  index of one of the numerous books on perl.
