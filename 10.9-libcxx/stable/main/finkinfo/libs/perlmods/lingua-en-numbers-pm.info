Description: Convert 407 to "four hundred and seven", etc
DescDetail: <<
This module provides a function num2en, which converts a number (such as 123)
into English text ("one hundred and twenty-three"). It also provides a function
num2en_ordinal, which converts a number into the ordinal form in words, so 54
becomes "fifty-fourth".

If you pass either function something that doesn't look like a number, they
will return undef.

This module can handle integers like "12" or "-3" and real numbers like
"53.19".

This module also understands exponential notation -- it turns "4E9" into "four
times ten to the ninth"). And it even turns "INF", "-INF", "NaN" into
"infinity", "negative infinity", and "not a number", respectively.

Any commas in the input numbers are ignored.
