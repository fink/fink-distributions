Description: Run an EV event loop asynchronously
DescDetail: <<
	This module implements a rather specialised event loop - it takes a
	normal EV event loop and runs it in a separate thread. That means it
	will poll for events even while your foreground Perl interpreter is busy
	(you don't need to have perls pseudo-threads enabled for this either).
	
	Whenever the event loop detecs new events, it will interrupt perl and
	ask it to invoke all the pending watcher callbacks. This invocation will
	be "synchronous" (in the perl thread), but it can happen at any time.
	
	See the documentation for Async::Interrupt for details on when and how
	your perl program can be interrupted (and how to avoid it), and how to
	integrate background event loops into foreground ones.
