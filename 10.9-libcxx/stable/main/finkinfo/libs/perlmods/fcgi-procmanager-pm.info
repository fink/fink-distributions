DescDetail: <<
 FCGI::ProcManager is used to serve as a FastCGI process manager. By
 re-implementing it in perl, developers can more finely tune performance in
 their web applications, and can take advantage of copy-on-write semantics
 prevalent in UNIX kernel process management. The process manager should be
 invoked before the caller''s request loop.
