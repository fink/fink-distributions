Description: Perl interface to the pkg-config program 
DescDetail: <<
  The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
  usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them.

  ExtUtils::PkgConfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility, intended
  for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind libraries that
  pkg-config knows. It is really just boilerplate code that you would've
  written yourself.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Really does need pkg-config at runtime.
