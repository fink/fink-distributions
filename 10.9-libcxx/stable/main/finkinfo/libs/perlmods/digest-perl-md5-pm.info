Description: Pure-perl implementation of MD5 algorithm
DescDetail: <<
This is not an interface (like "Digest::MD5") but a Perl implementation
of MD5. It is written in perl only and because of this it is slow but it
works without C-Code. You should use "Digest::MD5" instead of this
module if it is available. This module is only usefull for

    computers where you cannot install "Digest::MD5" (e.g. lack of a
    C-Compiler)

    encrypting only small amounts of data (less than one million bytes).
    I use it to hash passwords.
