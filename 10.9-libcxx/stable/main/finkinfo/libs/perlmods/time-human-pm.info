DescDetail: <<
 This module provides a "vague" rendering of the time into natural language;
 it's originally intended for text-to-speech applications and other 
 speech-based interfaces.

 It's fully internationalised: if you look at the code, you'll see a global
 variable called %Time::Human::templates, which you can fill in for other
 languages. If you do multinationalise it, please send me templates for other
 languages to be added to future releases. You can set the default language 
 via the global variable $Time::Human::Language.

 $Time::Human::Evening and $Time::Human::Night decide the hours at which
 afternoon turns to evening and evening turns to night in your culture. For
 instance, Greeks may want evening to start at 11pm; for hackers, evening may
 start at 3am.
