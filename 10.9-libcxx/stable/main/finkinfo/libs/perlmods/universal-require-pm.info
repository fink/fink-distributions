DescDetail: <<
If you've ever had to do this...

  eval "require $module";

to get around the bareword caveats on require(), this module
is for you.  It creates a universal require() class method
that will work with every Perl module and its secure.  So
instead of doing some arcane eval() work, you can do this:

    $module->require;

It doesn't save you much typing, but it'll make alot more
sense to someone who's not a ninth level Perl acolyte.
