DescDetail: <<
  Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration,
  combination, and permutation of sets of elements and the mathematical
  relations that characterize their properties.  As a jumping off
  point, refer to:

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Combinatorics.html

  This module provides a pure-perl implementation of nCk, nPk, and n!
  (combination, permutation, and factorial, respectively).
