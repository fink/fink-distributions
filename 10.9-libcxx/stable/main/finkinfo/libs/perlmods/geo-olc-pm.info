distribution. The 'olc' script is packaged separately in 'olc'.

DescPackaging: <<
	Geo::OLC is pure-perl and has only pure-perl deps. The olc
	script has several perl-versioned deps. We package geo-old-pm
	as a light perl-unversioned package and olc as separate a
	system-perl-tied package with its perl-versioned deps.
