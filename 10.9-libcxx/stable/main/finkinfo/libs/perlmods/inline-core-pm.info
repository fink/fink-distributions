	Former maintainer: Benjamin Reed <inline-pm@fink.raccoonfink.com>

	Inline formerly had Inline::C included in tarball, and fink
	therefore included it in the inline-pmXXX packaging. Upstream
	moved Inline::C into a separate upstream distro. To avoid
	breaking packages that expect a dependency on inline-pmXXX to
	supply inline-c-pmXXX, we now have inline-pmXXX as a
	bundle that brings the separate Inline and Inline::C suites.

	If %p/bin/python (unversioned) is present, lots of self-test
	failures (and failures in reverse-depends packages, such as
	javascript-pmXXX):
	Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
	Failed to autogenerate /sw/build.build/javascript-pm5124-1.16-1/JavaScript-1.16/_Inline/config-darwin-thread-multi-2level-5.012004.
	for the variant that matches system-perl. No idea where the
	call to python is at all, let alone at the binary level.
	It seems to be caused by a process running two different versions of
	python (/usr/bin and %p/bin), but the original calls are very hidden.
