DescPackaging: <<
	Fails a self-test, consistent with other platforms, in a way
	that the test suite does not consider to be fatal. See:
	https://github.com/tokuhirom/Test-SharedFork/issues/26
	This is still better than fink's previous version, that was
	hopelessly incompatible with lots of things.
