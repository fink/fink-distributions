DescDetail: <<
This module is a low-level interface to the Mac OS X
Property List (plist) format.  You probably shouldn't use
this in applications -- build interfaces on top of this
so you don't have to put all the heinous multi-level
object stuff where people have to look at it.

You can parse a plist file and get back a data structure.
You can take that data structure and get back the plist
as XML.  If you want to change the structure inbetween
that's your business. :)
