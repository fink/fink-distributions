Description: Generate recursive-descent parsers
DescDetail: <<
Parse::RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent
text parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It
provides:

* Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),

* Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,

* Repeated and optional subrules within productions,

* Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,

* Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and
  parsing,

* The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
  productions during a parse,

* The ability to pass data up and down the parse tree ("down" via
  subrule argument lists, "up" via subrule return values)

* Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),

* Precompilation of parser objects,

* User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution via "scoring" of
  matching productions.
