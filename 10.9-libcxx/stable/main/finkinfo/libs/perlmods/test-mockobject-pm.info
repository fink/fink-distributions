DescDetail: <<
It's a simple program that doesn't use any other modules, and
those are easy to test.  More often, testing a program
completely means faking up input to another module, trying to
coax the right output from something you're not supposed to be
testing anyway.

Testing is a lot easier when you can control the entire
environment.  With Test::MockObject, you can get a lot closer.

Test::MockObject allows you to create objects that conform to
particular interfaces with very little code.  You don't have
to reimplement the behavior, just the input and the output.
