Description: LWP::UserAgent that protects you from harm
DescDetail: <<
The LWPx::ParanoidAgent is a class subclassing LWP::UserAgent, but
paranoid against attackers. It's to be used when you're fetching a
remote resource on behalf of a possibly malicious user.

This class can do whatever LWP::UserAgent can (callbacks, uploads from
files, etc), except proxy support is explicitly removed, because in
that case you should do your paranoia at your proxy.

Also, the schemes are limited to http and https, which are mapped to
LWPx::Protocol::http_paranoid and LWPx::Protocol::https_paranoid,
respectively, which are forked versions of the same ones without the
"_paranoid". Subclassing them didn't look possible, as they were
essentially just one huge function.

This class protects you from connecting to internal IP ranges (unless
you whitelist them), hostnames/IPs that you blacklist, remote
webserver tarpitting your process (the timeout parameter is changed to
be a global timeout over the entire process), and all combinations of
redirects and DNS tricks to otherwise tarpit and/or connect to
internal resources.
