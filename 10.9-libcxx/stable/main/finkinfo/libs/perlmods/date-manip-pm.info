Description: Date/time comparisons and calculations
DescDetail: <<
  This is a set of routines designed to make any common date/time
  manipulation easy to do.  Operations such as comparing two times,
  calculating a time a given amount of time from another, or parsing
  international times are all easily done.  From the very beginning, the main
  focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired date/time
  operation easily, not necessarily quickly.  Also, it is definitely oriented
  towards the type of operations we (as people) tend to think of rather than
  those operations used routinely by computers.  There are other modules that
  can do a subset of the operations available in Date::Manip much quicker
  than those presented here.

  As of version 6, a new object-oriented interface has been added, with more
  power and control than the legacy function interface. But version 6 also
  requires perl >= 5.10, so be careful to weigh portability vs modernity and
  power when writing your code. Package includes both versions, auto-selects
  at runtime based on perl version being used.
