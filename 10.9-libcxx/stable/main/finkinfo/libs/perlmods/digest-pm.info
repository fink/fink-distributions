DescDetail: <<
The Digest:: modules calculate digests, also called "fingerprints" or
"hashes", of some data, called a message.  The digest is (usually) some
small/fixed size string.  The actual size of the digest depend of the
algorithm used.  The message is simply a sequence of arbitrary bytes or
bits.

An important property of the digest algorithms is that the digest is
likely to change if the message change in some way.  Another property
is that digest functions are one-way functions, i.e. it should be hard
to find a message that correspond to some given digest.  Algorithms
differ in how "likely" and how "hard", as well as how efficient they
are to compute.
