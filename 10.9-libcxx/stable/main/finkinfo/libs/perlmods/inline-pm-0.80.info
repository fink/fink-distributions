DescPackaging: <<
	Former maintainer: Benjamin Reed <inline-pm@fink.raccoonfink.com>

	Inline formerly had Inline::C included in tarball, and fink
	therefore included it in the inline-pmXXX packaging. Upstream
	moved Inline::C into a separate upstream distro. To avoid
	breaking packages that expect a dependency on inline-pmXXX to
	supply inline-c-pmXXX, we now have inline-pmXXX as a
	bundle that brings the separate Inline and Inline::C suites.
