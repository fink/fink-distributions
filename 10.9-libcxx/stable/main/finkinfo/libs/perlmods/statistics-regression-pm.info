Description: Perl module for weighted linear regression
DescDetail: <<
Statistics/Regression.pm is a multivariate linear regression package.  That is,
it estimates the c coefficients for a line-fit of the type

y= c(0)*x(0) + c(1)*x1 + c(2)*x2 + ... + c(k)*xk

given a data set of N observations, each with k independent x variables and one
y variable.  Naturally, N must be greater than k---and preferably considerably
greater.  Any reasonable undergraduate statistics book will explain what a
regression is.  Most of the time, the user will provide a constant ('1') as
x(0) for each observation in order to allow the regression package to fit an
intercept.
