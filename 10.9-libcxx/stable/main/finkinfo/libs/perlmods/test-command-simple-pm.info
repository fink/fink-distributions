DescDetail: <<
Test::Command::Simple is a intended to simplify testing of external commands.
It does so by running the command under IPC::Open3, closing the stdin
immediately, and reading everything from the command's stdout and stderr. It
then makes the output available to be tested.

It is not (yet?) as feature-rich as Test::Cmd (in package libtest-cmd-perl),
however the interface to this is much simpler. Tests also plug directly into
the Test::Builder framework, which plays nice with Test::More.
