DescDetail: <<
	Net::Daemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable server
	applications in a very simple way.  The module is designed for Perl
	5.005 and threads, but can work with fork() and Perl 5.004.
	
	The Net::Daemon class offers methods for the most common tasks a
	daemon needs: Starting up, logging, accepting clients, authorization,
	restricting its own environment for security and doing the true work.
	You only have to override those methods that aren't appropriate for
	you, but typically inheriting will safe you a lot of work anyways.
