Description: Perl Module for writting IRC script in Perl
DescDetail: <<
  Net::IRC, a work in progress. First intended to be a quick tool for writing
  an IRC script in Perl, Net::IRC has grown into a comprehensive Perl
  implementation of the IRC protocol (RFC 1459), supported and developed by
  several members of the EFnet IRC channel #perl.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The upstream developer notes:

  This module has been deprecated, abandoned, and is no longer
  supported. It has not seen active development in five years, and its
  original author has moved on.  We *STRONGLY* recommend you port your
  code to either Bot::BasicBot or POE::Component::IRC. Please feel
  free to stop by irc.freenode.net/#perl for help making this
  transition.

Fink merely redistributes it and does not have the resources to assist
in porting to newer alternatives.
