DescDetail: <<
 This module implements the FSEvents API present in Mac OSX 10.5 and later. It
 enables you to watch a large directory tree and receive events when any 
 changes are made to directories or files within the tree.

 Event monitoring occurs in a separate C thread from the rest of your
 application.
