Description: Portable, pure-perl implementation of `which`
DescDetail: <<
File::Which is a portable implementation (in Perl) of `which', and can
be used to get the absolute filename of an executable program
installed somewhere in your PATH, or just check for its existence.

It formerly included the command-line utility `pwhich' which has the
same function as `which', but this was scrapped many versions ago.
