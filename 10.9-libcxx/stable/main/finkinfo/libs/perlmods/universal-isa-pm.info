DescDetail: <<
Whenever you use "isa" in UNIVERSAL as a function, a kitten using
Test::MockObject dies.  Normally, the kittens would be helpless,
but if they use UNIVERSAL::isa (the module whose docs you are
reading), the kittens can live long and prosper.

This module replaces UNIVERSAL::isa with a version that makes sure
that if it's called as a function on objects which override isa,
isa will be called on those objects as a method.
