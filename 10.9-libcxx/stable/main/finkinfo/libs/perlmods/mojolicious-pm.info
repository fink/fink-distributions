DescDetail: <<
Back in the early days of the web, many people learned Perl because of a
wonderful Perl library called CGI. It was simple enough to get started
without knowing much about the language and powerful enough to keep you
going, learning by doing was much fun. While most of the techniques used
are outdated now, the idea behind it is not. Mojolicious is a new attempt
at implementing this idea using state of the art technology.
