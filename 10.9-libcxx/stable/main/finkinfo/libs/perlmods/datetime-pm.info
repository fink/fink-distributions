DescDetail: <<
DateTime is a class for the representation of date/time combinations,
and is part of the Perl DateTime project.  For details on this project
please see http://datetime.perl.org/.  The DateTime site has a FAQ
which may help answer many "how do I do X?" questions.  The FAQ is at
http://datetime.perl.org/faq.html.

It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time
before its creation (in 1582).  This is sometimes known as the
"proleptic Gregorian calendar".  In this calendar, the first day of
the calendar (the epoch), is the first day of year 1, which
corresponds to the date which was (incorrectly) believed to be the
birth of Jesus Christ.

The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way differs 
rom how dates are often written using "BCE/CE" or "BC/AD".
