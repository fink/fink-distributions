Description: Acmeist PEG Parser Framework
DescDetail: <<
Pegex gets it name by combining Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG), with
Regular Expessions (Regex). That's actually what Pegex does.

PEG is the cool new way to elegantly specify recursive descent
grammars. The Perl 6 language is defined in terms of a self modifying
PEG language called Perl 6 Rules. Regexes are familiar to programmers
of most modern programming languages. Pegex defines a simple PEG
syntax, where all the terminals are regexes. This means that Pegex can
be quite fast and powerful.

Pegex attempts to be the simplest way to define new (or old) Domain
Specific Languages (DSLs) that need to be used in several programming
languages and environments. Things like JSON, YAML, Markdown etc. It
also great for writing parsers/compilers that only need to work in one
language.
