DescDetail: <<
This is a specialized POD viewer to extract embedded tests and code
examples from POD. It doesn't do much more than that. pod2test does the
useful work.

This module has been replaced by the newer Test::Inline 2. Most testing
code that currently works with "pod2test" should continue to work with
the new version. The most notable exceptions are "=for begin" and "=for
end", which are deprecated.

After upgrading, Pod::Tests and "pod2test" were split out to provide a
compatibility package for legacy code.
