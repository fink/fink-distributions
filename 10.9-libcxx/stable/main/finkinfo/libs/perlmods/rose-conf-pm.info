DescDetail: <<
Traditionally, module configuration information is stored in package
globals or lexicals, possibly with class methods as accessors.  This
system works, but it also means that looking up configuration
information requires loading the entire module.

Rose::Conf is a base class that promotes the collect all configuration
information for a module into a separate, lighter-weight module.
Configuration information may be imported as a hash into other
packages under any desired name, accessed via a param() class method,
or through a reference to the configuration hash returned by the
conf_hash() class method.
