Description: Profile subroutine calls in a perl program
DescDetail: <<
The profiler module is completely automatic in its basic mode.
You simply "use" the module at the top of you main script.
The module will then automatically instrument all subroutines
in the code, profile each subroutine call during the execution
of the script, and print out a report of usage
