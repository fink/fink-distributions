DescDetail: <<
CGI::Simple provides a relatively lightweight drop in replacement
for CGI.pm.  It shares an identical OO interface to CGI.pm for
parameter parsing, file upload, cookie handling and header
generation.  This module is entirely object oriented, however a
complete functional interface is available by using the
CGI::Simple::Standard module.

Essentially everything in CGI.pm that relates to the CGI (not
HTML) side of things is available.  There are even a few new
methods and additions to old ones!  If you are interested in what
has gone on under the hood see the Compatibility with CGI.pm
section at the end.
