DescDetail: <<
This module provides functions that are the inverse of built-in perl
functions localtime() and gmtime(). They accept a date as a
six-element array, and return the corresponding time(2) value in
seconds since the system epoch (Midnight, January 1, 1970 GMT on Unix,
for example). This value can be positive or negative, though POSIX
only requires support for positive values, so dates before the
system's epoch may not work on all operating systems.
