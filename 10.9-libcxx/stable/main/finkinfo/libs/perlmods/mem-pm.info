DescDetail: <<
mem is a syntactic-sugar pragma that allows use-ing a package as it is
previously defined, in the same file. This allows easy declaration of
specialized, typed data structures (like C struct definitions) that
increase code legibility and concept clarity. In a similar usage, the
constants pragma allows defining low-overhead, runtime constants.
