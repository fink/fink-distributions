DescDetail: <<
XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to XML format.  XML::Dumper can also read XML data
that was previously dumped by the module and convert it back to Perl.  You can
use the module read the XML from a file and write the XML to a file.  Perl
objects are blessed back to their original packaging; if the modules are
installed on the system where the perl objects are reconstituted from xml,
they will behave as expected.  Intuitively, if the perl objects are converted
and reconstituted in the same environment, all should be well.  And it is.
