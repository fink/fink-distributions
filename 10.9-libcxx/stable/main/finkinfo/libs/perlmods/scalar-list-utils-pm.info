Description: Common Scalar and List utility subroutines
DescDetail: <<
This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.
