# Has bundled version of File::ShareDir::Install that is used if
# no ext one present. Use it to avoid circular deps
#BuildDepends: file-sharedir-install-pm%type_pkg[perl] (>= 0.03)
# The bundled one doesn't seem to be found at test-time:
# https://github.com/fink/fink-distributions/issues/711
# but the external one doesn't seem to be needed by tests and
# obviously the bundled one exists, so remove the test for it
