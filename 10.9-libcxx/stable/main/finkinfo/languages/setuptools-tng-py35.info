DescDetail: <<
Easily download, build, install, upgrade, and uninstall Python
packages.

This package replaces the distribute and setuptools packages.

See also: pip and virtualenv
<<

DescPackaging: <<
	Because of dependency deadlocks against setuptools-py when a 
	'real' distribute-py package is installed, we have introduced 
	setuputils-tng, which has no Conflicts against it.
