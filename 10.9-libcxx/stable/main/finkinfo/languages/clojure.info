DescDetail: <<
Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java
Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a
general-purpose language, combining the approachability and
interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and
robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a
compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains
completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at
runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with
optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java
can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure
offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent
system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
