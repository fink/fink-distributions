 Description: Generic commands to invoke python%type_pkg[python]
 DescDetail: <<
  This package only contains non-versioned symlinks to the binaries included
  with python%type_pkg[python].
 <<
 DescUsage: <<
  This package should only be used when you don't care which version of the
  python 2.x interpreter you need.
 <<
<<
DocFiles: README LICENSE 
Description: Interpreted, object-oriented language
DescDetail: <<
 Python is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. 
 This package installs unix python - not the OSX Framework version.
 Builds a two-level namespace dynamic libpython (needed for koffice).

 The interpretter is installed as "python%type_raw[python]", and all associated
 commands are similarly named with the python-version in them. To get
 the simple "python" command, install the fink package "python" (note:
 the "python" command there is not guaranteed to be python%type_raw[python]!).
<<
DescUsage: <<
	python%type_raw[python] changes the compiler options used to compile
	third-party python modules. Please do not add %type_raw[python] variants
	to them without actually testing that they build cleanly.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
	Patch a lot of things to impliment shared-lib support for
	non-Framework build on Darwin.

	Static libpython is installed in lib/pythonX.X/config/ but
	shared goes in %p/lib by default. Fink's packaging has always
	placed manually-built shared lib in config/ along side static,
	This gives consistency regardless of -search_paths_first.
	Continue this practice so that -pyXX varianted packages don't
	need special-casing for certain variants.

	Make sure all compiled modules link against libpython%type_raw[python] (and
	propagate this to third-party compiled modules) to ensure that
	all symbols resolved at compile-time to avoid packager
	mistakes and user runtime surprises.

	Play lots of games to make sure we get expected support
	libraries.

	Adjust "python" unversioned link to be a symlink not a hard link.

	Must remain Epoch'ed so that this "python" pkg to be newer
	than the one from lower %v pkgs.

	Shared lib is buried next to static one instead of being in
	%p/lib because that's where it's always been in the fink
	package series. Why would they be in different places? Patch
	-config script to continue this tradition (bug in previous
	versions accidentally did the Right Thing here).
<<
DescPort: <<
	Patch setup.py to find ncursesw headers and drop libncurses5 dep.

	platform.mac_ver now works on 64 bit, but leave our posix.uname
	fallback in just in case.
	Fink's gdbm3 installs %p/include/ndbm.h but python expects
	%p/include/gdbm/ndbm.h so python ends up using /usr/include/ndbm.h
	but the lib from gdbm3 which is, shall we say, bad. Force it to find
	%p/include/ndbm.h instead.
	
	test_ctypes fails with clang unless _ctypes/_ctypes_test.c is built
	with -O0 so force that in setup.py.
	
	Patch ctypes to look in %p/lib for libraries.
	
	Upstream patch to build with readline 6.3.
	
	Upstream patch from https://bugs.python.org/issue27369 to fix tests
	with expat 2.2.0.

	Call build executable by correct filename in test suite
	(python on case-sensitive, python.exe on -insensitive file systems).

	On macOS11, ctypes test needs to know about shared library cache
	but not yet ported to release branches.
