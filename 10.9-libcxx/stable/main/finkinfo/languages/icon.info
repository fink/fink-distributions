Description: Very high level programming language
DescDetail: <<
Icon is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with a
large repertoire of features for processing data structures and
character strings. Icon is an imperative, procedural language with a
syntax reminiscent of C and Pascal, but with semantics at a much
higher level.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	dmacks: Remove whitespace between "-I" and its path because it
	is not portable to some compilers (not per spec at all). Also
	robustify the linking against build-dir library.
