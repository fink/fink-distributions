Description: Support lib/ subdir for tcl runtime packages
DescDetail: <<
The tcl interpretter looks in %p/lib and %p/lib/tclMAJOR.MINOR
for loading tcl packages at runtime. All direct subdirs of %p/lib
are also checked (%p/lib/foo not %p/lib/foo/bar), and other
tcl interpretters get access to all fink-packaged tcl packages simply
by adding %p/lib to their auto_path. That means a ton of modules
(tcl bundled, tk, and separately packaged) pile up in %p/lib.

Installing this fink package creates a %p/lib/%n directory and
triggers tcl to scan its direct subdirs as well. That means all tcl
packages can be accumulated in this subdir, helping to keep %p/lib
organized. It also contains subdirs for each tcl MAJOR.MINOR, for
packages that are somehow tied to a specific tcl version (bundled with
tcl core, linked against libtcl.dylib, etc.)
<<
DescUsage: <<
Fink packages that install tcl packages in %p/lib/%n must
have a runtime dependency on %n.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
By doing this via a separate fink package (rather than including it as
part of fink's tcltk package, or adding a hack to fink's tcl runtime
itself to check this subdir) we make it easier for other fink packages
to migrate to this system. Rather than needing a versioned dependency
on tcltk, one simply needs a dependency on this fink package, which
self-documents the support of this subdir.

Using the TCLLIBPATH env var (via fink's RuntimeVars) would also have
sufficed. However, the current implementation is not as
sensitive to shells with mis-configured dotfiles.
