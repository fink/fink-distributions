+/* For items that must be guarded by a lock, we use the following strategy:
+   If atomic support is available for a unit32_t we use that.
+   If not, we use the Darwin OSSpinLock implementation. */
+
+/* Algorithm motivations.
+
+Layout Assumptions:
+  o Darwin has a number of sub-targets with common atomic types that have no
+    'native' in-line handling, but are smaller than a cache-line.
+    E.G. PPC32 needs locking for >= 8byte quantities, X86/m32 for >=16.
+
+  o The _Atomic alignment of a "natural type" is no greater than the type size.
+
+  o There are no special guarantees about the alignment of _Atomic aggregates
+    other than those determined by the psABI.
+
+  o There are no guarantees that placement of an entity won't cause it to
+    straddle a cache-line boundary.
+
+  o Realistic User code will likely place several _Atomic qualified types in
+    close proximity (such that they fall within the same cache-line).
+    Similarly, arrays of _Atomic qualified items.
+
+Performance Assumptions:
+  o Collisions of address hashes for items (which make up the lock keys)
+    constitute the largest performance issue.
+
+  o We want to avoid unnecessary flushing of [lock table] cache-line(s) when
+    items are accessed.
+
+Implementation:
+  We maintain a table of locks, each lock being 4 bytes (at present). 
+  This choice of lock size gives some measure of equality in hash-collision
+  statistics between the 'atomic' and 'OSSpinLock' implementations, since the
+  lock size is fixed at 4 bytes for the latter.
+
+  The table occupies one physical page, and we attempt to align it to a
+  page boundary, appropriately.
+
+  For entities that need a lock, with sizes < one cache line:
+    Each entity that requires a lock, chooses the lock to use from the table on
+  the basis of a hash determined by its size and address.  The lower log2(size)
+  address bits are discarded on the assumption that the alignment of entities
+  will not be smaller than their size.
+  CHECKME: this is not verified for aggregates; it might be something that
+  could/should be enforced from the front ends (since _Atomic types are
+  allowed to have increased alignment c.f. 'normal').
+
+  For entities that need a lock, with sizes >= one cacheline_size:
+    We assume that the entity alignment >= log2(cacheline_size) and discard
+  log2(cacheline_size) bits from the address.
+  We then apply size/cacheline_size locks to cover the entity.
+
+  The idea is that this will typically result in distinct hash keys for items
+  placed close together.  The keys are mangled further such that the size is
+  included in the hash.
+
+  Finally, to attempt to make it such that the lock table entries are accessed
+  in a scattered manner,to avoid repeated cacheline flushes, the hash is
+  rearranged to attempt to maximise the most noise in the upper bits.
