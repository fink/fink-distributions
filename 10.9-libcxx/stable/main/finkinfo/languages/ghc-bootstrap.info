Description: Glasgow Haskell Bootstrap Compiler
DescDetail: <<
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured,  optimising
compiler and interactive environment for Haskell 98. GHC compiles
Haskell to either native code or C. It implements numerous experimental
language extensions to Haskell 98, for example: concurrency, a foreign
language interface, multi-parameter type classes, scoped type variables,
existential and universal quantification, unboxed types, exceptions,
weak pointers, and so on. GHC comes with a generational garbage collector,
and a space and time profiler.
