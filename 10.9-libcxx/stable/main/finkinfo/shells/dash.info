Revision: 1
Description: Debian Almquist Shell
DescDetail: <<
	dash (Debian Almquist Shell) is a POSIX compliant shell that is much
	smaller than bash. It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it
	executes scripts somewhat faster than bash), or as the default
	super-user shell. Because it depends on fewer libraries, it is
	therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade problem or a disk
	failure. It is also useful for checking whether a script uses only
	POSIX syntax. This shell was ported from NetBSD's ash.
