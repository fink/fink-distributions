DescDetail: <<
 tcsh (TENEX C Shell) is an enhanced version of the Berkeley
 Unix C shell (csh(1)). It includes all the features of 4.4BSD
 C shell, plus a command-line editor, programmable word completion,
 spelling correction and more.

DescPackaging: <<
 The homepage is actually from the Oreilly csh & tcsh
 book. It may not be official, but a) it's unusually informative,
 and b) astron.com doesn't appear to have a web presence at all.

Use patches and cflags settings from Apple tcsh-65 open source release.
Added patch for tests/subst.at to suppress failure in 124: Filename substitutio
due to limitations of fink-bld.
Also note the the testsuite exhibits an additional 21 unexpected failures when the
package is built with --no-build-as-nobody.
