Description: Set of motif based widgets
DescDetail: <<
Xbae consists of three widgets:

1. XbaeMatrix: The XbaeMatrix widget which displays a grid of cells in
   the same manner as a spreadsheet.

2. XbaeCaption: XbaeCaption is a simple Manager widget used to
   associate an XmLabel (caption) with it's single child.

3. XbaeInput: XbaeInput is a widget subclassed from XmText widget and
   allows keystrokes to be validated as well as the final string.

DescPackaging: <<
	DocFiles not used as all documentation installed with
	everything else.

	Patched configure to use fink's aclocal path without needing
	BuildDepends:automaken

	Originally packaged by Matt Stephenson.

	fangism bumped dep to openmotif4.

	Includes upstream fix for XmNrowButtonLabels breakage. See:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/xbae/patches/2/

	XQuartz-2.8.0 dropped libXp compile-time files (only retained
	the runtime dylib); disable detection in order to get
	deterministic results.
<<
DescPort: <<
	Needs flat-namespace libXt for compatibility with openmotif4
