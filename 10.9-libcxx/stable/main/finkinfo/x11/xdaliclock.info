DescDetail: <<
Dali Clock is a digital clock. When a digit changes, it "melts" into its
new shape. It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and the date is displayed
when the mouse is pressed. It has four large fonts built into it, but it
can animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits.The window
can be made transparent, and can do funky psychedelic color cycling.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package installs an X11 version of xdaliclock into %p/bin.

The .app and screensaver components are not supplied in this package.
It also installs a clickable OS X .app into /Applications/Fink
<<
DescPackaging: <<

	OSX target fails with a ton of errors relating to /var/empty/
	files (Cannot allocate memory, Failed to initialize simulator
	device set, and others). This appears to be as a result of
	recent security enhancements (SIP?) and/or newer xcode.
	Someone who wants the OSX-specific component (.app) is welcome
	to hack it.
