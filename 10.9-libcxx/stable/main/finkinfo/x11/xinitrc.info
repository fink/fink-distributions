DescDetail: <<
The xinitrc package provides a Fink-controlled mechanism by which Fink 
packages can have executables run, environment variables set, etc., at 
X11 startup, by running wrapper scripts in %p/etc/xinitrc.d.  On a stock X11
this can be done via scripts in /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d , but for 
Fink packages this would entail installing files outside of the Fink tree, 
which is normally forbidden.

In addition, 'xinitrc' provides well-defined points for system administrators
to set up the X11 environment as they require.  Consult the following files
for more information:

%p/share/doc/xinitrc/numbering.txt
%p/share/doc/xinitrc/README.txt

Note: This package installs its own /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc, though it
renames the original version installed the system so that it isn't lost.

Note:  This package will need to be reinstalled every time X11 is updated,
including OS updates.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Packages that need xinitrc's functionality should  install a sh script named
'%p/etc/xinitrc.d/XYfoo.sh', where XY should follow the convention in 
%p/share/doc/xinitrc/numbering.txt, and 'foo' can refer to the package, 
executable, or some other unique name.

The contents of the script should either terminate or run in the background so
that the X11 startup will proceed normally and e.g. run a window manager.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
1.5-2:  source /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/98-user.sh in xinitrc.sh so 
	    that users don't experience a change in behavior when installing the
	    package.  Currently we just patch that in.   
	    Anybody backporting to 10.4 will require a different patch, as per the
	    10.4 section of http://finkers.wordpress.com/2010/06/18/finks-xinitrc-gnome-and-kde/
