DescDetail: <<
amiwm is an X window manager that tries to make your display look and feel
like an Amiga Workbench screen. It is fully functional and can do all the
usual window manager stuff, like moving and resizing windows.

The purpose of amiwm is to make life more pleasant for Amiga-freaks like
myself who has/wants to use UNIX workstations once in a while. It can also
be used on the Amiga with the AmiWin X server, although this part needs
some more work.
