DescDetail: <<
pekwm is a window manager that once up on a time was based on the 
aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no longer 
resembles aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded feature-set, 
including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), 
autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports keychains, 
and much more.

* Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be 
  noticed.
* Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.
* Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things 
  appear as they should when starting applications.
* Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.
