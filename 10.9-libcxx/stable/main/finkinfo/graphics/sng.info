Description: Markup language for representing PNG contents
DescDetail: <<
 SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed
 specifically to represent the entire contents of a PNG
 (Portable Network Graphics) file in an editable form. Thus,
 SNGs representing elaborate graphics images and ancillary
 chunk data can be readily generated or modified using only
 text tools.

 SNG is implemented by a compiler/decompiler called sng that
 losslessly translates between SNG and PNG
