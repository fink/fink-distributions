Description: Trace bitmaps into scalable vector graphics
DescDetail: <<
Potrace(TM) is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming
a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM,
PGM, PPM, or BMP format), and the output is one of several vector file
formats. A typical use is to create SVG or PDF files from scanned
data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The
resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then
be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: SVG, PDF,
EPS, PostScript, DXF, GeoJSON, PGM (for easy antialiasing of
pixel-based images), Gimppath, and XFig. Additional backends might be
added in the future.

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to
pre-process the input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and
color images.
