Package: libwebp7
Version: 1.2.0
Revision: 2
Description: Library for manipulating WebP format
DescDetail: <<
	WebP is a method of lossy compression that can be used on photographic
	images. The degree of compression is adjustable so a user can choose
	the trade-off between file size and image quality.

	A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a container based on RIFF.
	Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use the WebP
	format to create smaller, better looking images that can help make the
	web faster.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Will not build in the presence of freeglut so BuildConflicts with it.
	configure expects to only find OpenGL.framework on OS X and gets
	horribly confused by another GL. No easy way to fix.
