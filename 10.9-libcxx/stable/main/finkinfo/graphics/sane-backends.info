DescDetail: <<
	SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an
	application programming interface (API) that provides
	standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware
	(flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras,
	frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE API is public domain and its
	discussion and development is open to everybody.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Edit %p/etc/sane.d/dll.conf to enable only specific
backends for a noticeable performance gain.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	dvips can't seem to find its tex.pro, so disable it

	Back-end modules are loaded as libsane-FOO.V_MAJOR.so, so we
	need -version-info for the -bundle (using -avoid-version gives
	libsane-FOO.so only). Maybe should hack the target name to
	include V_MAJOR instead of relying on libtool SONAME games?

	Loading is done by mach-o/dyld.h, so could probably scrap the
	unversioned .so and the .la files.
