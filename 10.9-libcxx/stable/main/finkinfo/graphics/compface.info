Description: 48x48x1 image compression and decompression
DescPackaging: <<
	Originally packaged by Masanori Sekino.

	Patch Makefile.in to create shared library instead of static.
	Install it manually rather than patching the "install" target.

	dmacks--overhauled to link binary against dylib, pull all
	install handling into makefile; install new utility script
	manually.

	Debian contacted the author to clarify the licensing. We
	import that information, and also some other of their
	patches. Their patch alters Makefile in a linux-centric way,
	but our patchfile alters Makefile.in, which the build uses to
	regenerate Makefile that is to our liking. No harm, so not
	bothering to 'filterdiff' to exclude it.
