Description: Free color management engine in 100K
DescDetail: <<
 Little cms intends to be a small-footprint, speed optimized color
 management engine in open source form. Since the initial release, 
 back in 1998, lcms has been continuously evolving, mostly thanks 
 to contributions done by skilled programmers, who generously donated 
 their valuable time to review the engine and the documentation. 
 For now, little cms has been ported to a big number of platforms and
 is currently used in many open source and commercial products, as well 
 as being distributed in major linux enviroments. 
<<
DescUsage: <<
 The utilities jpgicc, linkicc, psicc, tificc, transicc
 and their man pages are in the splitoff package lcms2-bin.
 Detailed documentation in pdf form is in %p/share/doc/lcms2-shlibs 
 in the splitoff package lcms2-shlibs.
