Description: Optimizer for PNG files
DescDetail: <<
OptiPNG is a PNG optimizer that recompresses the image files
to a smaller size, without losing any information. The idea
has been inspired from pngcrush. The implementation is carried
forward in OptiPNG, which offers a faster execution per trial,
and a wider search space.
