Description: Read and write TIFF image files
DescDetail: <<
Read and write image data from and to TIFF files.

Image and metadata can be read from TIFF, BigTIFF, OME-TIFF, STK, LSM, NIH,
SGI, ImageJ, MicroManager, FluoView, SEQ and GEL files.  Only a subset of
the TIFF specification is supported, mainly uncompressed and losslessly
compressed 2**(0 to 6) bit integer, 16, 32 and 64-bit float, grayscale and
RGB(A) images, which are commonly used in bio-scientific imaging.
Specifically, reading JPEG and CCITT compressed image data or EXIF, IPTC,
GPS, and XMP metadata is not implemented.  Only primary info records are
read for STK, FluoView, MicroManager, and NIH image formats.
