DescDetail: <<
Imagine you captured a nice video with your camcorder, compact 
camera or even cell phone while skiing, cycling or whatever 
sports and the video is basically just jiggled. Modern cameras 
come along with hardware stabilisation, however this does not 
work if you have really strong vibrations - rather the contrary 
sometimes this mechanisms start to oscillate. Vid.Stab is your 
friend in this matter. It is designed to stabilize even 
strongly jiggled clips.
