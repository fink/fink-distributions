Description: Compatibility for glibc ftw calls
DescDetail: <<
  ftw is not present on OS X until 10.4 (nor on NetBSD), and is
  reported to be non-functional on 10.4. OS X and NetBSD have fts
  instead, but its functions are not directly compatible with ftw's.

  This package contains BSD ftw() function and associated constants
  implemented using the fts_*() functions. The nftw() function is not
  implemented.
<<
DescUsage: <<
  Pass -I%p/include/ftw -L%p/lib -lftw to your compiler/linker in
  order to access this library.
<<
DescPort: <<
  ftw.[ch] Ripped off of vasi's apt-ftparchive package. That header
  declared a nftw fuctnion but the .c did not implement it, so we'll
  just replace the unresolved declaration with a compile-time error if
  someone uses it.

  dmacks added a dinky compile of the lib, and added unistd.h so that
  10.4/XCode2 gets the NULL symbol.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  The header is buried beyond the reach of the default #include search
  paths so we don't interfere with compiling that expects to find the
  system's own header.
