Description: PHP class to read gettext MO files directly
DescDetail: <<
The GNU gettext library is a widely used localization library, but in
order to use it with the PHP language, the system has to support the
desired locale, and library itself must be installed.

Since this is not always the case, PHP-gettext has been developed to be
able to read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other
than PHP.

Currently, it's usable if you develop most of the infrastructure for
choosing language on your own, because it's possible to use both
gettext() and ngettext() calls. In the near future, it should also be
fully compatible drop-in replacement for all of gettext functionality
written in PHP.
