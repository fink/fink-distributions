.
This package depends on the default implementation of the client development
libraries and header files (API and ABI defined by MySQL). Depending on the
default defined through this metapackage, the underlying implementation may be
provided by either MySQL or MariaDB. Build-Depend on this package and then
link using -lmysqlclient. You will end up with a binary that depends on either
libmysqlclient.so.X or libmariadbclient.so.X depending on the current default.
dpkg-shlibdeps should correctly generate a dependency on libmysqlclientX or
libmariadbclientX as appropriate.
