Description: Instant Messaging client
DescDetail: <<
Gaim is a clone of AOL's Instant Messenger client. It features
nearly all of the functionality of the official AIM client while
also being smaller and faster. Gaim also has plugins that let
you use ICQ, Yahoo, MSN, IRC, Jabber, Napster, and Zephyr.
<<
DescPort: <<
Perl's DynaLoader on OS X is broken, it exports two symbols (dlsym and dlclose)
which conflict with dlcompat, and break plugin support in gaim. To work around
this, we manually make these symbols static.

Had to set the optimizations down from -O2 to -O to work around an Apple gcc3 bug.

Changed default browser to "open %s" (which invokes the user's default browser).

Enabled libao support, even though it's useless - the Mac OS X driver in libao2
is pretty incomplete and useless.
