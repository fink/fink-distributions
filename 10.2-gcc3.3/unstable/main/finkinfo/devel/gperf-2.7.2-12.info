Description: Perfect hash function generator
DescDetail: <<
This is GNU gperf. It is a program that generates perfect
hash functions for sets of key words. A perfect hash function is:

A hash function and a data structure that allows
recognition of a key word in a set of words using
exactly 1 probe into the data structure.

The doc/gperf.html file explains how the program works,
the form of the input, what options are available, and hints on
choosing the best options for particular key words set.

My first package, probably has bugs, I would appreciate
criticism.
Needed by all the EDA stuff I have my eye on (such as
gEDA).
