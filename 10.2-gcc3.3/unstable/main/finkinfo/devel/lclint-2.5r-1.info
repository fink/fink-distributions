Description: Statically checks C programs
DescDetail: <<
With minimal effort, LCLint can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, LCLint can perform stronger checks than can be done by any standard lint
<<
DescPort: <<
	-I%b/src/Headers added because it was forgotten
	-DUNIX otherwise osd_getEnvironmentVariable in osd.c always return NULL
	CPP was hardcoded to gcc, replace it with $CC (= cc)
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	modified the Makefile because it didn't feature prefix nor DESTDIR
