Description: Graphics generation library
DescDetail: <<
 The GD library is useful for creating graphics like hit counters on
 the fly. This version supports the PNG, JPEG and WBMP formats and lets
 you use TrueType fonts rendered via freetype2.
<<
DescPort: <<
 The dynamic library needs the -fno-common switch.
 For some reason, libiconv is not found at link time, so we explicitly
  invoke it.
 When an older version is installed, the wrong library version may be
  linked against; the CCLD="gcc -L./.libs" is a workaround for this.
 A small patch is needed in order to allow this to link to the version
  of the freetype2 library supplied with Panther.  (Patch sent upstream
  on 21 May 2004.)

DescPackaging: <<
 This package is based on previous work by Chris Pepper, Jeremy Higgs
 and Peter O'Gorman.  Previously maintained by Christoph Pfisterer.
