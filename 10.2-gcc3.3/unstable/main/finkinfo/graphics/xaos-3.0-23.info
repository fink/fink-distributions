Description: Fractal explorer
DescDetail: << 
XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. It
displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) and
allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal. It uses lots of optimization
techniques to save about 97% of calculations necessary to calculate next
frame to make zooming as fast as possible.

To make result more interesting, various coloring modes, formulas,
planes and palette are supported. XaoS is also able to record and replay
animations using simple script language. We've prepared about half an
hour long movie "Introduction to fractals" with over 500 images and
animations.

For those who are lazy to explore fractals manually an autopilot
function is provided.
