DescDetail: <<
rdesktop is an open source client for Windows NT/2000 Terminal Server,
capable of natively speaking its Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) in
order to present the user's NT/2000 desktop. Unlike Citrix ICA, no
server extensions are required.

DescPort: <<
The OS X patch by David Boone (dave@iboone.net) resolves a problem with
vanilla rdesktop-1.1.0 whereby typing any character results in a
disconnect. The keycode mappings are now stored in a separate kbcodes.h
file rather than within xwin.c itself. Some keys or key combinations
may not work. If this is the case, please mail me, David and/or
the upstream developers (rdesktop@rdesktop.org).
