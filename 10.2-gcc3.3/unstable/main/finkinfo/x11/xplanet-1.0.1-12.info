Description: Earth and planet renderer
DescDetail: <<
Xplanet is similar to Xearth, where an image of the earth is rendered 
into an X window.  Xplanet can display several different map 
projections, including Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, 
or rectangular, as well as a window with a globe the user can rotate 
interactively.  The other planets and some satellites may also be 
displayed.  The latest version can always be found at 
http://xplanet.sourceforge.net.

A man page is available. Also see %p/share/doc/%n/README. Configuration 
options are documented in %p/share/doc/%n/README.config. Those using 
xplanet as part of a screensaver and/or upgrading from a previous 
version of xplanet should read the NEWS file. Many critical things have 
changed, including settings for use with xscreensaver.
