Package: gpsdrive
Version: 2.08pre12
Revision: 1
Description: GPS-based navigation tool
DescDetail: <<
GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. GpsDrive
displays your position provided from your NMEA capable GPS receiver on
a zoomable map, the map file is autoselected depending of the position
and prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival"
software is running. The maps are autoselected for best resolution
depending of your position and can be downloaded from Internet. All
Garmin GPS reveiver with a serial output should be usable, also other
GPS receiver which supports NMEA protocol.

For optional MySQL support, install 'mysql-shlibs'.

Garmin is disabled in this Fink package at this time.
<<
DescUsage: <<
'man gpsdrive' to get started.

You may have to adjust the /dev path for communication with Garmin.

There are reports that mouse buttons do not work correctly. The
following was posted to the gpsdrive mailing list:

  I had this problem and haven't been able to fix it, but I have found that
  with a two-button mouse you can actually duplicate the right and left
  button behaviours in a strange way: you have to click both buttons first
  the mouse clicking the one you want and without relasing clicking the
  second one, thus:
  
  left-click-hold, right click-release: left click
  right-click-hold, left click-release: right click

Have to move doc files by hand (./configure putting doc files in
--datadir along with pix (DATADIR gets hard-coded; prog looks for
DATADIR/gpsdrive/filename.ext). Should doc files go in DATADIR/doc?

At run-time, gpsdrive checks if the MySQL client library is available,
and enables MySql support if so (mysql version 3/libversion 10).
Besides patching in the Fink mysql lib path, we patch out any mysql
lib paths that are not libversion-specific, just to be safe. Also
scrap the dist mysql headers and patch to get from standard locations.

Need a way (--with-mysql-client= ?) to pass non-standard mysql lib
(path and filename (but could guess default filenames if passed a
path?>). Maybe --with-mysql-headers= path to dir of .h so could use
matching headers to installed lib to over-ride  the dist -Imysql?

ccache disabled due to occasional gpsd.c problems (thanks to Ben Hines
for the way to disable it).

The patch -module is needed to cause libtool to instruct the linker to
build g_module_open()able .so files (cf. -bundle giving .dylib). Has
anybody gotten a configure.ac or .m4 fragment to automatically set
these flags correctly on all platforms?

Module linking is broken by default. The problem seems to be that the
libtool that is created doesn't construct the correct linker flags in
response to -module. The libtool created using ltmain.sh from libtool
1.5 (fink's libtool14) gets it right, so copy that one and regenerate
configure.

Modules are segregated within lib/%n.

--with-debug may allow some optimization flags to leak through.

Garmin disabled (lots of prototyping non-portability...should just
use sys/types.h for everyone, etc., but haven't fixed it yet).

-Ddlsym= (if needed) seems to be needed *very* early in ./configure
(it takes effect late, but apparently has some side-effect on some AC_
or AM_ macro and if not given early gpsdrive finds MySQL but then
segfaults). So we'll just use the CFLAGS env until someone figures out
what's going on.

If MySQL dlopen succeeds by dlsym fails (i.e., dlsym _ omitted),
segfault during startup (EXC_BAD_ACCESS/KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS in
gtk_box_pack_start in _start (crt.c:267) in start) (during or just
after splash-screen; before main window is created.

Fink's dlcompat-shlibs-20030629-1 has a broken dlopen() in libdl.dylib. 
Fixed in -2 (and not broken in older versions).

Often the Quit button causes a segfault.

If the main window is dragged so that the penguin icon is entirely
off-screen, get lots of:
  (gpsdrive:6483): Gdk-CRITICAL **: file gdkmain-x11.c: line 648 (gdk_error_trap_pop): assertion `gdk_error_traps != NULL' failed

Fixed some weirdness relating to crypt. Was using the presence of
crypt.h to indicate availability of crypt(). Now check for the
function itself (possibly in libcrypt).

Removed duplicate dlsym and crypt blocks from configure.ac.

Renamed nlist[] since libm has a symbol with the same name.
