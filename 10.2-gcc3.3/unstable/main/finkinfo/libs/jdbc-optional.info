Description: JDBC Data Access API Addon
DescDetail: <<
JDBC technology is an API that lets you access virtually any tabular data
source from the Java programming language.  It provides cross-DBMS
connectivity to a wide range of SQL databases, and now, with the new JDBC
API, it also provides access to other tabular data sources, such as
spreadsheets or flat files. 

This package contains additional classes not provided with the Java2
platform.  It is necessary for any JDBC application that uses a DataSource
object to make a connection, uses connection pooling, or uses distributed
transactions.
<<
DescPort: <<
Builds just fine out of the box, all I had to do was create the profile
scripts and jar the compiled classes up.  I also manually ran javadoc to
create API documentation.

Note that no LICENSE file was provided with the source zip file, it has
been added with the patch; it was cut-and-pasted from the Sun download
page.
