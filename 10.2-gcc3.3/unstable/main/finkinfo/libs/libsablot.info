Description: XML processor (XPATH, XSLT, DOM2) Library
DescDetail: <<
Sablotron is an XML processor implementing XPath 1.0, XSLT 1.0 and DOM
Level2. It also includes some other features such as XSLT debugger, SXP
(access to external documents via callbacks) or EXSLT support.

Sablotron is a single shared library written in C++ (sablot.dll or
libsablot.so.x.xx). It provides a native C API; APIs for Perl, PHP,
Python, Ruby and other languages are available through wrappers (not
part of the Sablotron project). See gingerall.org for more information
on Sablotron wrappers. Sablotron can also be used from the command line
via a simple interface called sabcmd.

Sablotron also include an XPath Processor (SXP) working with virtual DOM
objects accessed via user-defined (DOM-like) callback functions. The C
API to SXP is described in a separate SXP Reference guide.

DescPort: <<
configure: warning: Your system doesn't support standard widechar
library (wchar.h), result of the <xsl:sort> instruction may be undefined

[1] - Use package libtool
ltconfig for this package is in a subfolder: tools, you can use this
version by passing -no-undefined to LDFLAGS. You may also have to set
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH: -I/sw/include, so the package can find the includes
to the libraries if they are not in a system directory.

[2] - Use Finks updated libtool
Libtool needs to be hacked to enable two_level_namespace to build with weak
linking. Set UpdateLibtool: True before running configure Add: 
no_undefined_flag='-undefined error' to ltconfig in the darwin case block
under $allow_undefined_flag='-undefined suppress'. After running configure
but before make, search and replace the following In libtool:
'\$allow_undefined_flag -o' and replace with -undefined error -o.
