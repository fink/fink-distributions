Description: Extended processing of command line options
DescDetail: <<
  Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
  GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
  line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
  the traditional one-letter options.

  In general, this means that command line options can have long names
  instead of single letters, and are introduced with a double dash `--'.

  Optionally, Getopt::Long can support the traditional bundling of
  single-letter command line options.

  Getopt::Long::GetOptions() is part of the Perl 5 distribution. It is
  the successor of newgetopt.pl that came with Perl 4. It is fully
  upward compatible. In fact, the Perl 5 version of newgetopt.pl is just
  a wrapper around the module.
