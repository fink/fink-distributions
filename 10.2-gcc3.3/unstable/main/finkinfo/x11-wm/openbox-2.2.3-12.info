Description: Another Window Manager not unlike blackbox
DescDetail: <<
Openbox is a window manager for the X11 windowing system. It currently runs on
a large list of platforms. It was originally based on Blackbox and currently
remains very similar, even using Blackbox styles (with available extensions)
for its themeing.

Openbox is written to be fast. It is designed to be both fast in functionality
and in performance. Meaning that you, as a user, can do what you want quickly,
and the window manager will respond quickly to your every request.

Another goal of Openbox is to be usable. What good is a piece of software if it
is hard to use and, then ends up going unused. Openbox aims to take its
original codebase to the next level. To make everything - from shading a window
to configuring the window manager - easier. But to do this while maintaining
the bloat-free approach that has been present in Blackbox from the beginning.
To present a slim, speedy, attractive window-manager-alternative for everybody.

Openbox is open-source and licensed under a BSD style license.
