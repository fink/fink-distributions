Description: Powerful unix shell
DescDetail: <<
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells
most resembles the Korn shell (ksh). It includes enhancements of many
types, notably in the command-line editor, options for customising its
behaviour, filename globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel
more at home and extra features drawn from tcsh.
