Description: Shell Users' Revolutionary Front Rage Against the Web
DescDetail: <<
Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
slashdot and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen
lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in
unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.
<<
DescUsage: <<
You must first edit <prefix> /etc/surfraw.conf and set SURFRAW_graphical to
no since it is unlikely that you have a graphical web browser that it can
recognise.
