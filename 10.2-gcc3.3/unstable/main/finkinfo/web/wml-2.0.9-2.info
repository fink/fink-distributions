Description: Offline HTML generation toolkit
DescDetail: <<
WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
particular core language. While not trivial and idiot proof WML provides
most of the core features real hackers always wanted for HTML generation.
<<
DescPort:<<
 Hmmm... using the CFLAGS for including the libraries but not setting LDFLAGS
 might be a bit of an evil hack but is required to trick wml's configure script
 without any more patching...
 
 (if both LDFLAGS and CFLAGS are set, configure breaks. but if LDFLAGS is not 
   set to -L/sw/lib configure can't find -lpng, hence set CFLAGS to that value)
   
 Be sure to have moved out all the old perl stuff out of the way. A typical 
 build failure would be an undefined symbol _perl_get_sv in p3_eperl
