Description: Search Engine
DescDetail: <<
mnogosearch is a full-featured search engine software for intranet and
internet servers. UdmSearch is a free software covered by the GNU
General Public License.

<<
DescUsage: <<
mnogosearch consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism
(indexer). The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS
servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents and
storing meta-data about those documents in an SQL database in a smart
and efficient manner.

After every document is referenced by its corresponding URL, meta-data,
collected by the indexer is used later in the search process. The search
is performed via Web interface. C CGI, PHP3 and Perl search front ends
are included.
