Description: TCP/IP swiss army knife
DescDetail: <<
A featured networking utility which reads and writes data across network
connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable
"back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other
programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network
debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
<<
DescPort: <<
This package replaces the older unmaintained netcat-1.10 package with one
based off of the latest GNU Netcat sources. It uses the Epoch field to
let fink know that it should be considered 'newer' than the old 1.10 pkg.
