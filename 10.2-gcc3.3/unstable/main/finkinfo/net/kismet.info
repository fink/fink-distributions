Package: kismet
Version: 3.0.1
Revision: 11
Description: 802.11 wireless network sniffer
DescDetail: <<
Kismet is an 802.11 wireless network sniffer - this is different from
a normal network sniffer (such as Ethereal or tcpdump) because it
separates and identifies different wireless networks in the area.
Kismet works with any 802.11b wireless card which is capable of
reporting raw packets (rfmon support), which include any prism2 based
card (Linksys, D-Link, Rangelan, etc), Cisco Aironet cards, and
Orinoco based cards. Kismet also supports the WSP100 802.11b remote
sensor by Network Chemistry and is able to monitor 802.11a networks
with cards which use the ar5k chipset.

DescUsage: <<
QUICK START

Detailed information about each of these steps can be found in the
appropriate section of the documentation.

   1. Compile and Install Kismet
   2. Configure kismet.conf and kismet_ui.conf for your card and
      setup. Make sure to put a valid, non-root user as the 'suiduser'
      option. This user is the account kismet will run as once it has
      attached to the capture source.
   3. Run kismet_monitor to enable rfmon mode, optionally with the
      channel hopper. kismet_monitor must be run as root because it
      changes the state of the card.
   4. Run kismet. Kismet should be run as the user you specified as
      the 'suiduser'. If kismet is started as root, it will drop privs
      to this user, but the frontend will still run as root.

If you have not already, read the docs in docs/ and edit
etc/kismet/kismet.conf to configure it for your system.  If you do not
configure this, Kismet will NOT run properly!

DescPort: <<
Remove all traces of included GNU getopt (will use Fink's).  Added
needed flags to find it and keep getopt.h happy. Sources all specifiy
their own getopt.h, so patch to use any.

Setting a CPPFLAGS -I for GNU getopt passes preprocessor test but also
beed to pass it as CFLAGS -Wp in order to pass compiler test.

This needs Viha (for AirPort support) (README says supports 0.0.1a,
may work with 0.0.2). But 0.0.1a is only available as a precompiled
binary that cannot be relocated from /Library (so cannot make a fink
package). The only 0.0.2 thing I see looks like a very different
program altogether, so will just force the user to manually install
viha-0.0.1a via a system-viha package.

Fink's ethereal (-ssl) doesn't install libwiretap so disable ethereal.

All config files from etc/ consolidated into etc/%n.

Not installing the extras (so not docs/README.extras either).
